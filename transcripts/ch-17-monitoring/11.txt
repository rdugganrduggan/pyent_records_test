00:01 So it was really cool that we went to Rollbar and we saw the error message 
00:05 but how do we get notified? I mean, this is better than logging by a long shot 
00:09 but it's not as good as I said it could be. 
00:12 Well, you have a little bit more configuration to do for that. 
00:15 So, let's go over here and look at my email, check this out, in my email, 
00:20 just five minutes ago I got pretty much what we got in our dashboard, 
00:25 so bam, an error has occurred, Python For Entrepreneurs Course in dev mode, 
00:30 here is the error, and this just shows you the trace back of all the various things 
00:35 that I showed you when we looked around, OK. 
00:38 So that's really great. But, there is more options OK, so let's go over here, 
00:43 click on settings for the project and go to make sure you have source control integrated, 
00:48 so you can get extra information, but notifications, that's where we want to go, 
00:52 so right now we have email, and we could connect this to Bitbucket issues 
00:58 or if you are using Campfire or create GitHub issues automatically from this, 
01:02 all of those are awesome, I'll just scroll through, we got Jira, we've got Slack, 
01:07 we've got Trello, you can sort of break out of the box and do web hooks, 
01:12 all you want, I am going to integrate this with Slack. 
01:15 OK, so we come down here, I have already authorized Slack
01:21 and I am going to say enable Slack integration, it says cool I am going to use this 
01:25 and where is it going to go, I am going to post to a runtime, 
01:29 so we are going to post all he errors to runtime, save those settings, 
01:33 and then if we come down here you can see on a tenth error, 
01:39 tenth time error occurrs, we could sent that and it's an error not a message, 
01:43 when there is a deployment, and how do we know like if something gets reactivated 
01:49 or whatever, we are going to get all of these sent. 
01:52 But if for some reason I don't want to know when an item is reopened, 
01:56 I could just delete that, right. 
02:00 OK, so let's go cause that error again. 
02:03 Here it is, and if I hit it again, it's going to happen again, 
02:07 actually let me just make a different error 
02:09 so you can see what it looks like the first time.
02:12 It's going to be a ValueError, and this is going to trigger it, here we go, 
02:19 sign in again and "Ka Boom!", ValueError. 
02:24 OK, now notice, I got a little pop up already right there, now it depends on 
02:28 how your Slack is set up, if it pops up like an actual notification, 
02:31 or it just says "hey, there is something going on, look at this, red thing Rollbar", 
02:35 nice message, there has been an error in dev, a new ValueError, kaboom, 
02:42 there is some of your notifications, right, and if you have the Slack app installed 
02:46 for your phone and you turn on notifications for this channel, 
02:49 you can create a special runtime channel or something, right, 
02:52 and then you will get those notifications popping up on your phone, straight away, 
02:56 so again, we can just click here and let's use Chrome 
02:59 because that is where it's authenticated against, and we'll pull it up, and there it is,
03:03 "Ka Boom", ValueError in all the stuff that you would expect to see. 
03:08 So, that is how you set up the notification side, so don't forget to do that 
03:13 because that is where some of the biggest value for what you have in Rollbar is, 
03:18 the fact that you get notified straight away. 
03:22 Final thing to notice is we have a dev section here, if we go over to settings, 
03:25 you can see here we have environments dev, there could be test, 
03:28 there could be production, you can hide the notifications and messages 
03:33 from various things, so you can come over here and say "I don't want to see dev errors", 
03:37 I only want to see production errors, or production and staging, whatever, right, 
03:41 but you probably don't want to leave this on, 
03:44 because you will get freaked out - "oh my gosh there is something wrong with the website", 
03:46 no, actually, it's just somebody doing some development and they are not done.
03:51 Something like that. So that is how you add Rollbar to a Pyramid app. 
03:57 I have this running in all of my Pyramid apps, and it has saved me more than once.

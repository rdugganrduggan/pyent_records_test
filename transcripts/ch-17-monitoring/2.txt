00:03 Welcome to level one, logging. 
00:06 So here is a log file from Talk Python Training, 
00:09 I've edited it down for a couple of things, condense some information 
00:14 to remove things like usernames or email addresses and whatnot, 
00:17 but this is more or less what comes off of the server. 
00:21 And, here I want to highlight a couple of things we can learn about this log, 
00:25 in fact, I learned a few things even just looking at it 
00:29 for this presentation, so hey, that's pretty cool. 
00:32 Alright. now let's start with user actions, so here you can see 
00:35 I've specifically added login information to the account controller 
00:42 to the purchase controller, things like that. 
00:45 So you can see here, here is a case where a user successfully logged in to the app 
00:49 and coming back to the class, thank you, whoever that is, that's awesome. 
00:53 They can also see over here that somebody who is not yet a user 
00:57 has come to the website and they filled out that Mailchimp newsletter form
01:00 right on the front page that says "hey I am not ready to buy class yet 
01:04 but some of the stuff on your list looks really cool, 
01:06 just let me know when it's finished", so they enter their email address, 
01:08 and they subscribed to the mailing list, also very cool, thank you. 
01:12 And down here, you can see somebody has logged out, 
01:16 so in my actual logs I have the username and email address 
01:20 just so I can sort of corelate that back to who these people are, 
01:23 but of course, I don't really want to violate their privacy. 
01:27 So I took that out, but you can add these actions, so you see "oh, cool, 
01:30 people are using my web app in this way". 
01:33 We can also see things like search engines, so down here 
01:36 you can see some kind of search engine is trying 
01:40 to actually get to the lecture 52018 from this course. 
01:45 Well, that search engine didn't buy access to that course 
01:49 so I am not letting them in, I am actually not sure where that is coming from, 
01:53 and that's one of the things I am learning, I tweaked my sitemap a little bit 
01:56 and I am not really sure how it got here so I am going to look into this, 
02:02 but nonetheless, you can see what search engines are up to, 
02:05 and you can even see what hackers are up to, and let me just tell you, 
02:09 if you have a website on the internet, it is constantly under attack, 
02:14 you put a website up, it gets a little bit popular,
02:18 you'll be blown away at like how many hack attempts are on it. 
02:22 So, here we can see that somebody is trying to look and see 
02:27 if I am running a Wordpress site, and if I am they are going to then flip over, 
02:32 they are trying to load the login page and then they are going to start dictionary attacking it 
02:36 or using default passwords or something like that. 
02:40 So you are "oh my god, someone is hacking my site", yeah, they do it, all the time. 
02:45 So, you just have to make sure that you have your security story down, 
02:49 you have to make sure that your website is patched, 
02:53 do that in Linux or whatever right, behind the scenes and make sure it's patched, 
02:57 make sure that all your dependencies like Pyramid stuff are up to date, 
03:01 like you need to be super vigilant because you can see 
03:04 even in just the simple set of logs here, people are hacking way on it, 
03:08 and these are just the ones that went to places that were not found, right, 
03:13 who knows what else is they are doing that I haven't put logging in for. 
03:18 So the big question is "how do I generate this log"? 
03:21 Python itself has logging built in, but I want to show you something 
03:26 that I think is a pretty significant improvement over Python's default logging. 
03:31 And that is Logbook. So Logbook is a package put together by Armin Ronacher, 
03:37 Armin Ronacher is the guy behind Flask so you know this is solid software, 
03:41 and you can see from this little welcome to Logbook "hello world" example 
03:45 that it's very simple to get started, you'll see that it's nice to compose these
03:50 across different layers of our application, lots of good stuff, OK. 
03:55 So over the next couple of videos, we're going to be introducing Logbook 
03:59 adding Logbook to our web application, and logging a couple of types of information,
04:04 application startup and some of the requests, like you saw in that previous screen.

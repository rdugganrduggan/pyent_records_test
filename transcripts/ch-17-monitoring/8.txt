00:02 Logging is great, but how often do you actually look at your log files? 
00:05 When something is wrong with your application, you want to know, 
00:09 you need to know right now, you would like everyone on the team to get a notice, 
00:13 "the website is down, users are getting errors" and so on. 
00:17 So, the way we do this is by integrating some kind of monitoring system 
00:23 into our web application, the one that I recommend 
00:27 and the one that I've been using for a long time, is called Rollbar. 
00:31 And, Rollbar is cool because it works across many different technologies 
00:34 like it's great with Python, but it also works with NoJs, client-side JavaScript, .NET, 
00:39 you name it, Ruby, lots of different platforms are supported, 
00:43 so you can sort of bring all of your monitoring from different applications 
00:47 together even if you are not using Python for everything. 
00:50 So, we're going to go and look inside of Rollbar 
00:54 and I'l take you on a tour of my Rollbar account, then we'll create a new application, 
00:59 which is going to be the monitoring app, 
01:03 or the app that we are going to monitor inside Rollbar 
01:06 and we are going to associate that with our Blue / Yellow Rockets web app 
01:09 that we've been building this whole time. 
01:12 And then, once we get it setup, we'll see if there is an error, we'll get a notification
01:16 in all sorts of places, we can setup our email, I am going to setup a Slack channel 
01:21 so we'll get a notification in Slack, and then when we do get that notification of the error, 
01:25 it actually contains all this information, it contains information
01:30 about where the stack trace or traceback was, 
01:33 what the value of the local variables when it crashed were, 
01:37 what operating system and browser were they using 
01:41 when they caused this crash and so on, and so on.
01:44 Lots of pieces of information we'll be able to use here 
01:47 to really quickly track down and solve the problem. Alright, let's get going to Rollbar.

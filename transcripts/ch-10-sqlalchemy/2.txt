00:03 Let's talk for a moment about some popular deployments of SQLAlchemy. 
00:08 So, I think it's really important when you use a technology to see 
00:12 that there are other major companies being successful with it, 
00:15 often importantly beyond the realm in which you are going to use it, 
00:19 so you know what you are getting into is going to scale as far as you need it to. 
00:23 So let's look at what some major companies are doing with SQLAlchemy. 
00:27 Dropbox is using SQLAlchemy internally, doing some really cool stuff, 
00:32 remember, Dropbox is basically the center of the universe for Python 
00:35 with the founder Guido van Rossum there and a bunch of the core developers, 
00:40 so this is a good thing to know that they are using SQLAlchemy. 
00:44 Uber, I love Uber, so much better than taxis, right, and Uber you can imagine, 
00:48 this is a huge deployment that Uber has 
00:52 in terms of all of their data needs, SQLAlchemy here, that's great.
00:56 Reddit, Reddit is interesting in that they use the core, not the ORM layer, 
01:00 and Reddit gets a ton of traffic, 
01:03 and Reddit is using SQLAlchemy, so that is really cool. 
01:06 Firefox is using it, OpenStack, the open source alternative to like AWS, right, 
01:13 there is huge set of tools and cloud infrastructure, those guys are using that, 
01:18 Fresh Books for invoices and billing, like if you are an independent contractor, 
01:23 and you want to create invoices and give them your clients, 
01:27 Fresh Books, they use SQLAlchemy, that's great. 
01:30 Hulu, Hulu is pretty sweet, lots of video streaming fun to be had there,
01:34 and that video streaming fun is powered by- you guessed it, SQLAlchemy.
01:38 Yelp, Yelp is pretty awesome. Triomet, shout out to the local transit 
01:42 here in Portland Oregon, so that is like the buses and the trains and whatnot. 
01:46 And of course, Talk Python and my related websites, like I said, 
01:51 the website that you are looking at right now is powered by SQLAlchemy. 
01:55 If you want to know exactly what each one of these companies is doing, 
01:59 with SQLAlchemy, you can see SQLAlchemy.org/organizations.html 
02:02 that link there at the bottom lists all of these companies and many more 
02:06 and it actually has a paragraph or two describing 
02:08 what each one of them are doing with SQLAlchemy. 
02:11 So if you want to dig in even farther, go and have a look
02:14 otherwise, we are going to get started digging into the details of SQLAlchemy.

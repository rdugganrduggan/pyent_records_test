00:02 Now that we have our schema created, let's actually query some data. 
00:05 Now, in order to either insert, update, delete, or query data, we're going to 
00:11 need to talk about this DbSessionFactory and the unit of work pattern. 
00:15 The way SQLAlchemy works, we've already said, is 
00:18 to use the unit of work design pattern 
00:21 and what that means is you begin a unit of work, you make a bunch of 
00:23 changes, inserts, updates and deletes and then when you are finally done 
00:28 you can either abandon the unit of work or you can commit it. 
00:32 The final step here is to actually create the thing that manages this unit of work for us.
00:37 OK, so if we look up here, we are going to need to import sqlalchemy.orm 
00:44 and down here we're going to create, I am going to say
00:47 sqlalchmey.orm.sessionmaker, kind of like declarative base.
00:51 This factory method here is going to create this thing that will itself be 
00:56 a callable function that can make these unit of works. 
01:00 So we are going to need to store it somewhere, I'll call it a session_factory 
01:05 and so we are just going to do store it here, we'll say DbSessionFactory.session_factory 
01:15 the name maybe gives away, let's just call it factory, right, 
01:18 because there is too many sessions in here.
01:21 And let's go ahead and set that to be None initially, 
01:24 and then we'll do a test, remember, I said we want one and only one engine 
01:27 so we are going to bind the engine here, 
01:30 so this tells the factory basically how to tie itself back to the database 
01:36 and the base classes and all these things. 
01:39 And again, we don't want to actually run this method over and over, 
01:43 we run it two times, we get two engines, that would be bad, 
01:46 so let's do a little test here, so we'll say if this is already created, 
01:50 we're just going to return, there is nothing to do, OK? And in this sense, 
01:55 we're only going to be able to ever create one of these engines per connection,
01:58 in this case we're just doing one, so here we go, this is going to be great. 
02:02 Now we're ready to basically call this like this, so we want a session, 
02:07 we'll not do this here really but this is what we're going to do.

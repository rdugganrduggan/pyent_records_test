00:01 It's time to actually insert some data into our web application.
00:04 Now, you can see I've added right here an admin_controller,
00:06 it has this standard GET / POST / Redirect pattern
00:09 for editing data. And we've done this before. We did this in the advanced web section.
00:14 Part two of web development. Remember, we just changed stuff in memory
00:18 We just printed out something, we didn't actually put something in the database,
00:21 because we didn't have SQLAlchemy or any data access technology
00:24 that we had talked about.
00:26 But we're going to follow the same pattern
00:28 GET - it's gonna show the form, POST is going handle it and you can see
00:31 I've got a "todo" down here and we're going to insert some data,
00:35 We'll insert an album and a bunch of tracks that go with it
00:38 and we're gonna log the fact tht that was done and just a printout,
00:41 Not really logging, we'll get to that later.
00:44 And we can look at this new_album.pt
00:46 Alright, a really simple form here, I've done a little bit of work
00:49 to make it look prettier, so for example
00:51 I've added some Bootstrap here, some Bootstrap stuff over here,
00:56 so it's gonna look a little bit nicer
00:58 but we basically have the things you need to create an album.
01:01 We've got title here, price, album image and URL and
01:04 then, we're not gonna go all-in and create a huge backend
01:08 for managing albums and tracks and reordering them and so on.
01:12 What we're gonna do is we're just gonna take a bunch of track titles,
01:14 and we're gonna use that to sort of build a some kind of data relationship
01:20 and in the real life, you could of course use this technique to go on
01:23 and extend what we're doing to let you manage and reorder tracks
01:26 or whatever your equivalent of nested related items are.
01:33 OK, so we're gonna take this, we also have down here
01:36 a newalbumviewmodel, but that just basically will transfer that stuff
01:40 to and from the form and then also has this cool property that I added to it
01:46 that given "new line separated", so one per line,
01:51 text that represents the track titles, it will turn that into
01:54 a tightened-up list of track titles and we're going to use that
01:59 to create the tracks, like I said in the real one, we'd wanna have
02:02 the length of the track, then various things, maybe audio link to an mp3
02:07 that would let us preview it and so on, but this is just gonna be a
02:10 a simple little trick for us to get started

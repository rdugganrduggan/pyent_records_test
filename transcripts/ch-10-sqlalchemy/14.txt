00:00 So let's review, real quickly.
00:03 The core element of what we did was this create album method,
00:06 so we created an album and we gave it the data needed,
00:09 the way we did this is we create a session using the session factory,
00:12 in this case we were inserting so we allocate new objects
00:15 and add them to the session,
00:17 we want to add some related dependent objects like these tracks,
00:20 so we go and use our relationship that we have,
00:23 we append to the tracks and when things got inserted,
00:26 all the foreign key relationships
00:28 for the auto-incremented ids were all worked out
00:31 we called commit, we returned the album, we did a little print,
00:34 we haven't looked at that yet but somewhere in here
00:37 there should be created a new album with id 2.
00:41 So you can see that after we called commit our album
00:45 now actually had its primary key back which we can use for all sorts of things,
00:50 you maybe want to use this for further processing in your app.

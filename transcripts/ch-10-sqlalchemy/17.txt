00:01 Finally let's talk about inserting data.
00:03 We've seen the unit of work in action with this session
00:07 and inserting objects are no different.
00:09 So again, we are going to use a session factory to create a session
00:11 and then to insert new objects, we just create new instances
00:14 at the types that map to those particular tables.
00:17 So if we want to create a new album, we just create a new album,
00:20 and we are going to set some properties.
00:22 In the example you saw me write the code,
00:24 I actually use name value keyword arguments to set the name
00:28 and the year in the album initializer.
00:31 But, you could just as well create them and sat them like this in an operative way
00:35 and that would be totally fine.
00:37 This is not yet putting the database, we are still going to have to add it to the session,
00:40 we also want to associate some tracks with this album,
00:42 so we are going to create a new track.
00:45 And we can actually go bidirectionally with these relationships,
00:48 so we could either set the album on the track that maps
00:52 from track to album to the one here, or like you saw in the other example,
00:56 we could go to album.tracks and add this track.
00:59 Either direction has the same effect.
01:02 We can set the details of the track and name, title, whatever.
01:05 Create another track again, set it up with this album
01:09 so now this album has two tracks,
01:11 if we tell the session I'd like to add this album to the database,
01:14 we are almost ready there, so everything is queued up, the unit of work is queued up
01:19 and then we have to commit it and now all those three items
01:22 and their relationships will be created in the database.

00:04 You'll see it in action as we go through the rest of the course,
00:07 so you'll probably learn a few more things, but I think you know

00:17 why it was built and so on, from the creator of SQLAlchemy himself,
00:21 listen to this Talk Python episode number 5 with Mike Bayer
00:25 who created SQLAlchemy back in 2005
00:28 and he talks about how it's evolved over time,
00:31 from 2005 to I think this was recorded in 2015.

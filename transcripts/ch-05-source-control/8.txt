00:01 It's time for a whirlwind tour of GitHub, the service that's near and dear to my heart
00:04 because I use it pretty much every single day in order to store and manage my own code.
00:09 Go to github.com right now in your browser,
00:13 assuming you don't already have an account, you'll come across a page that looks like this;
00:16 this landing page allows you to quickly sign up for a free GitHub account,
00:19 just go ahead and pick a username, email address and password and click sign up.
00:23 This is the logged in GitHub dashboard that will show you the activity
00:27 that's happening among people that you follow
00:29 and it'll show you your own repositories and the work that you're doing.
00:33 What we have on the left side, are the people that I follow and the activities that they've done.
00:37 So for example when Eddie Zane stars a repository
00:40 I get a look at that when I come into my dashboard.
00:44 We can also see other people that I don't follow who performed activities on my repository,
00:48 so for example I have a Python project called "underwear"
00:52 and someone has stared that project.
00:54 So the gist with this dashboard is it just gives you the activities
00:56 that people that you follow and people that have interacted with your projects  have made on them.
01:01 On the right hand side, we'll see the repositories that we've contributed to
01:05 and the repositories that I have under my control.
01:08 The next page that we want to look at is the profile page.
01:11 So if we click the icon at the top, we could say your profile
01:15 and this will bring you to the profile page,
01:17 this will show you any of the repositories that you're working on, your top repositories,
01:21 you can actually customize which repositories you want to be shown here and then
01:25 you can see the number of contributions that you've done, that are highlighted by each day.
01:30 You can also fill out your profile, which can be used for other people
01:33 to just know who you are and what you are working on
01:68 and the gist is we get an at a glance all the things that we are working on with our projects.
01:39 Now for you, if you are starting a business,
01:41 you may only have a single project or maybe a couple of different projects
01:44 that you are working on, you don't really need a great GitHub profile,
01:47 but active developers have a ton of contributions
01:50 and things that they are working on via GitHub.
01:53 So we've seen the dashboard page, this profile page,
01:56 we can also take a look at other people's profiles,
01:58 so let's take a look at Michael Kennedy's profile,
02:01 if we go to mikeckennedy, it's going to bring up his profile,
02:05 if you follow someone on GitHub, you'll see all the activity that they do
02:08 or the other repositories that they star,
02:11 so when we go back to the dashboard, we can see the people
02:14 that we're following, all the things that they are working on or what they've stared,
02:16 and at first I didn't really understand why would you want to follow people on GitHub
02:20 and the gist is once you follow a bunch of people, you can see what their activity is
02:24 and it's a really great way to stay up to date with what libraries
02:27 that they are interested in or what projects are they working on,
02:30 at a glance be able to keep up with all the developers that you know.
02:33 We know what the dashboard page looks like,
02:35 we know what our own profile page and other profiles look like,
02:38 let's jump over into the account settings,
02:42 so click the icon again and when you drop down the settings, click on that,
02:46 under account settings you can customize your profile,
02:48 so if you want to add a link you your personal website or your new business
02:51 that you are building, you can put that in your GitHub profile,
02:54 there are couple of tabs you also are going to want to know about,
02:56 the first would be just notifications, under notifications you can specify
03:00 whether you want to receive emails or just notifications via the web,
03:04 once you log in onto your GitHub account,
03:06 this page just gives you control over the notifications that you receive.
03:10 Another important page is security, and this is where you can turn on
03:13 for example two-factor authentication.
03:15 I recommend that once you start your business,
03:17 especially if you have a private repository, you turn on two-factor authentication
03:21 your account is much more difficult to hack when you have two-factor authentication on.
03:24 Two more pages that are useful, this little bell up here is the notifications tab,
03:29 now I don't have any notifications right now,
03:31 but typically when you are working on projects, you'll have a bunch of notifications
03:35 whether that's pull requests or issues that are filed against your project,
03:38 now if you have private projects, obviously no one else is going to be able
03:41 to see that but if you are working with other people on those projects,
03:43 you'll get some notifications for what they've been working on or if they've @ mentioned you
03:48 in some pull request that they are trying to make, some improvement to the project.
03:51 So the notifications page is really useful, where you see at a glance
03:54 what's happening and what other people are trying to notify you on.
03:58 The last thing is to create a new repository,
04:01 so we can click the little plus icon and we can say new repository
04:04 or we can import a repository, which just means if we have an existing one
04:07 we can import that as well, but the new repository window
04:10 the new repository screen lets us punch in some basic information
04:13 about our repository and then I'll create what is essentially an empty repository
04:17 that we can then clone from GitHub; but we're not ready for that quite yet,
04:20 what we need to do next is create some SSH keys
04:23 that allow us to interact with the repository,
04:25 so that's the gist behind GitHub, this is the create repository screen,
04:29 we have the dashboard page, which allows us to see at a glance
04:32 what activity is happening on GitHub, all the people that we're following,
04:35 all of our repositories, we have the profile page,
04:38 which allows us to see our own profile, follow people if we're looking at a different profile
04:42 and we had the account settings,
04:45 which we can modify our profile or increase our security, change our password,
04:48 those basic things.
04:50 So that's a whirlwind tour of what GitHub offers us for working with Git repositories.

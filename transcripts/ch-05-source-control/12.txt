00:01 Whether you're on Windows, Linux or Mac,
00:03 we now have both the public and private SSH key
00:05 that will allow us to control access to our repositories on our GitHub account.
00:09 Switch over into location where you've created your public and private keys.
00:14 We can say we have our private key and again,
00:17 don't share your private key with anyone
00:19 because it's the only mechanism we have to control access to our repositories.
00:22 And then we have our public key, we take a look at what's inside our public key,
00:26 we're going to see a hash with our email address.
00:29 now go ahead and copy this and we're going to paste it into GitHub in just a moment;
00:35 switch over to your browser where you have GitHub open.
00:38 Now chances are your account's looking pretty barren right now,
00:40 because you haven't created any repositories,
00:42 and you haven't really done any work with your GitHub account.
00:45 We're going to change that very soon. But first, we need to add this public SSH key to our account.
00:50 Click on your account's icon, and go to settings.
00:54 Over on the left side, click SSH and GPG keys
00:58 and then click the button for new SSH key,
01:00 give it a title, such as the computer that you're on, like Macbook
01:04 and we could say "Development key", just some sort of description
01:07 that allows us to know what we're adding this key for.
01:10 Then paste in the contents of that key file, just double check there are no spaces
01:15 or anything that was added in there,
01:17 but GitHub likely will complain if there's any problems with it, click add SSH key.
01:22 Now we have that added to our account and we can use this to control privileges
01:26 for creating and cloning repositories on our account,
01:29 so that's all we needed to do to add an SSH key,
01:32 a public SSH key onto our GitHub account
01:35 and now we're going to be able to use this as access privileges on our account.

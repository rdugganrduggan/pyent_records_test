00:01 GitHub makes it really easy to create a Git repositories through their user interface
00:05 and that's what we'll take a look at in this video.
00:08 Log into your GitHub account, and bring up your profile page,
00:11 we're going to click the plus icon up at the top and say "new repository",
00:15 give your repository a name for the project that you're working on,
00:18 you can just call it "myproject" for now.
00:20 So give it the name that you want for yours.
00:22 Give it an optional description. "This is the code for my project."
00:28 and then here is a really important part,
00:30 you can make this repository either public or private,
00:33 one thing to note is that if you don't have an upgraded account for $7 a month,
00:37 you won't be able to create private repositories,
00:39 so if I click on this right now, it will ask me to upgrade my account.
00:43 For this video we'll just create a public repository
00:46 that will serve as an example for what we're creating,
00:50 there is a few other options down here, one is: "Do you want to initialize this repository
00:54 with the readme file?". This readme file is a description of what the project is
00:59 some installation instructions, really whatever you want to put in there
01:02 that you think is going to be useful to the reader.
01:04 And that reader might be you, say six months or a year down the road
01:08 if you start working on the project and set it aside,
01:10 every project should have a readme with some explicit instructions
01:13 for how to set it up and what the project's purpose is.
01:16 We'll click "initialize this repository with the readme",
01:19 and then there is two other parts here you can add .gitignore file
01:22 and this is going to specify the Git "hey, these are a bunch of files
01:25 that I don't want added to version controlling, don't track these files."
01:29 And these are set up for specific programming languages,
01:32 in this case we'll choose Python and we can add a license,
01:35 licenses are typically used for open source projects, and I use the MIT license,
01:40 if you're just building your business,
01:41 then chances are you won't have to worry about a license,
01:44 it's really for open source projects so that people understand
01:47 what the explicit responsibilities are when using the code that comes in that repository.
01:51 Once we've got all this set up, we can click "Create repository", awesome.
01:56 Now, we've got the files that we've specified, yes we wanted the gitignore,
02:00 we have a license, which is the MIT
02:06 and we have a readme file, which specifies that this is my project
02:11 and just the description, and then we can work on these files.
02:14 The next step would be to clone or download this project,
02:17 so we could just go over here and say "download a zip file"
02:19 and this will contain all of the files that are in this repository,
02:23 that can be really useful, but what we really want to do is work on this project
02:26 and that's where we are going to need to clone this repository.
02:29 This is the URL that we can use to clone the repository
02:31 which will give us all the files and the version history
02:34 for that Git repository locally on our system.

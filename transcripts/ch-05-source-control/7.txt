00:01 We are taking a look at the source control concept and the implementation
00:04 known as Git so far in this video course.
00:06 And now we are going to talk about GitHub.
00:08 GitHub is a cloud service that allows us to store and manage our Git repositories;
00:14 GitHub is certainly not required for using git but it's often conflated with git
00:19 by new developers, because they are used hand in hand in many different projects.
00:24 Let's get some clarity on the difference
00:26 between Git, the source control system and GitHub, the cloud service.
00:30 Git is an implementation of the source control concept,
00:34 so it is a specific tool that we use from the command line.
00:38 And it simply allows us to store and manage our code in repositories.
00:43 GitHub on the other hand is a company that provides a web application
00:46 for managing Git repositories, it makes it much easier to use git
00:51 because now we have a user interface
00:53 with which you create and manage Git repositories if we choose;
00:57 it hosts the remote repositories, so the great part about this is
01:00 it's providing a back up service,
01:03 if our laptop that we're developing our business on suddenly crashes,
01:06 we know we have an exact copy up on GitHub
01:09 and we can always just sync our new laptop and grab all the files that we were working on.
01:13 GitHub also makes it easier to work with other people, so for example,
01:17 later in this course we'll talk about contractors and if you hire contractors
01:21 it's often easier just to give them access to your code through GitHub
01:24 rather than them having to sync their repositories with your repositories
01:28 and just use laptops, you can use GitHub as a central location for your source code.
01:33 GitHub is also going to assist us with our deployments later,
01:36 so as we go on to build our application, and we're ready to deploy it to a cloud server,
01:41 we are going to use GitHub as a bridge between the code that we have in our Git repository
01:45 and the location that we're going to deploy it to.
01:49 And here is how Git works.
01:51 Let's say all of my code and everything that I've been working on
01:54 are in a Git repository on my local laptop.
01:57 Then, I create a repository on GitHub, I'll push all my code up there,
02:01 I'll use the "git push" command, so that I have a remote repository to push code to.
02:05 So I'll say something like "git push origin master",
02:09 we'll take a look at these exact commands
02:10 once we get into the Git specifics in the next section.
02:13 But for right now, this is just an overview of what we're doing.
02:16 We can also pull the code down, so for example if I'm working with someone else
02:20 and they've pushed their code up to GitHub,
02:22 I can then pull it down with the "git pull" command,
02:24 it makes it really easy to have a central location for all of the code
02:28 that way if I'm working on it on my own,
02:30 I can simply be assured that I have a place that it's all backed up,
02:33 or if I'm working with other people, it's not only backed up
02:36 but we know that we have the source of truth for our code.
02:39 An important concept with GitHub is that there are both public and private repositories,
02:44 when you sign up for GitHub, which we'll do in the next video,
02:47 you'll get unlimited public repositories,
02:50 now the one thing you need to really be careful of,
02:52 is that your code is visible to the entire internet, anyone can see a public repository,
02:57 it's an all or nothing deal, either it's public and everyone can see it
03:00 or it's private and only you can see it
03:03 along with the people that you've manually added to that project.
03:07 Now personal accounts are $7 a month for the private repositories
03:11 they are also free for students, if you are a student,
03:13 you should be able to get access to as many private repositories as you want just for free;
03:17 while I know $7 a month can be cost prohibitive in some cases,
03:20 I highly recommend that you get a personal account for the $7 a month
03:24 when you start building your business, that way you can keep your code private.
03:28 While you are working through these videos, you can just simply use a free GitHub account,
03:31 and upgrade it when you're ready to start your business.

00:01 In this section, we are going to go over source control with Git and GitHub.
00:04 But what is source control?
00:06 Source control is a concept,
00:08 and we are going to use a specific implementation of source control named Git.
00:12 Source control stores the project files,
00:15 all of your code and related documentation,
00:17 and every modification made to those files.
00:21 Source control is also commonly referred to as version control,
00:25 so you'll hear those terms used interchangeably.
00:28 A huge advantage to using source control is it allows us to track changes
00:32 made to each of our files and then revert to previous versions,
00:35 just in case we made mistakes
00:37 or we want to go back to a previous feature that we had.
00:41 Now when should we use source control?
00:43 Use source control right from the beginning of our project.
00:46 It's important not only for independent projects, ones that you are working on just by yourself,
00:51 and also projects that you are working on with others,
00:54 it's truly required for working with others, so that you don't step on each other's toes
00:57 when it comes to making changes to your code.
01:01 And the best part about source control is that it allows you to aggressively experiment with your code.

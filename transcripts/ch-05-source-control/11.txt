00:01 If you're using Windows, you can download an application
00:03 that will generate SSH keys for you, there's nothing built into the operating system
00:07 that will allow you to create a key pair like ssh-keygen on Linux or Mac
00:11 but we can use a separate program to do this for us.
00:15 So that's what we're going to do in this video,
00:16 if you are using Linux or Mac feel free to skip this one.
00:20 At your Windows desktop, click on your browser of choice,
00:23 and bring out putty.org, that's P-U-T-T-Y.org.
00:29 Click the link to download PuTTY but we don't want the putty.exe file,
00:35 what we want is PuTTYgen, so go ahead and download that file,
00:42 save it, and we can run it.
00:45 A newer versions of Windows may tell you that you can't run the file
00:50 because you don't have appropriate permissions,
00:52 but in our case we do want "more info" and we want to say "run anyway".
00:55 This is the PuTTY Key Generator, you can think of it like a user interface
00:59 that's very similar to ssh-keygen on Linux or Mac.
01:02 Make sure that "SSH-2 RSA" is selected and then click generate.
01:07 And we want to randomly move our mouse around
01:09 and that will allow us to have some randomness that will be input into the key.
01:14 Just go ahead keep moving your mouse around
01:16 until the green bar is all the way over to the right side.
01:24 After we've moved our mouse around enough to generate randomness,
01:29 we'll get the key generated, now what you'll see here is the public key
01:34 for pasting into an authorized key file or for uploading to GitHub,
01:39 so we can copy and paste that and put that wherever we want.
01:42 This is public key, so anyone can have this, this file can be shared publicly.
01:46 Now just like with the ssh-keygen command, we can add a pass phrase if we choose.
01:52 For a development key, I typically say that you should use a pass phrase,
01:55 now if you're automating a deployment, you may not want a pass phrase,
01:58 but in our case, for a development key, we do want to add a key phrase,
02:02 add a secure pass phrase, it has to be the same on both,
02:08 and then you can select save public key and we can save this wherever,
02:12 under downloads you might want to call it just entrepreneurs.pub
02:19 and we can save our private key and we call this just entrepreneurs.
02:26 We can bring this up in our downloads folder, this is the public key,
02:31 we can share this widely, we'll copy and paste this into GitHub
02:34 and then we have our private key.
02:36 So that's how we generate public and private keys on Windows
02:40 using the PuTTYgen application.

00:01 Let's get ready to use Git by downloading and installing it on our system.
00:04 Now in this video, we'll use Mac Os X
00:08 but the steps should be roughly the same on Windows or Linux.
00:12 The first thing you want to do is open a new browser tab,
00:16 and go to git-scm.com.
00:22 This is the main page for Git.
00:25 Go ahead and scroll down, go to the downloads page
00:28 and you'll see download links for all the major operating systems
00:32 and then it'll auto detect which operating system you are using
00:36 and then give you a little download button over here on the right.
00:41 We'll say download for Mac, the download will get started,
00:44 and we'll get it on our system, this will give us the latest version of Git.
00:49 Once this download is complete,
00:51 we'll just need to click on it, and on Mac it will verify, open it up,
00:56 and we can just open this up.
01:00 Now, the one issue you may have is
01:03 if you have not enabled unidentified packages under security
01:07 you will need to go into system preferences and update the security for that.
01:13 Go under security settings and we can say unlock the changes,
01:20 enter your password, and allow apps to be downloaded from anywhere.
01:27 Now you can say allow from anywhere or you can just specify that one last place.
01:33 Close this, go back to it, continue, install, again password,
01:41 it is installing software that will be used system-wide
01:45 and that is why it actually needs your system password.
01:49 Close this, we can close this out, now the last piece,
01:52 we just need to go into terminal in order to be able to use it,
01:56 so I can open up a new finder window,
01:59 go to applications, utilities, terminal, double click on terminal
02:05 then we type in the command "git", we're all set.
02:08 Now we can start using it.
02:10 Now that we've downloaded and installed Git
02:12 we just need to perform a few first-time configuration commands
02:15 and that's what we'll work on in the next video.

00:01 Now that we've downloaded and installed Git,
00:02 we just need to perform a few first-time setup commands,
00:05 in order to get things up and running.
00:07 Now you only need to run these commands once,
00:10 so just keep that in mind, you don't need to do this every time you start out Git.
00:14 Back in the terminal, we can now work with Git.
00:17 Let's run our first set of commands,
00:19 now we are going to use the "git config" command, there is a whole lot of options here,
00:24 we are really just going to run four commands.
00:27 The first thing we want to do is set up our username,
00:31 this is how it is going to identify us, who we are, this is our natural name.
00:35 So we'll type "git config" and we'll give it the --global,
00:40 we're saying we're setting this up for all of Git on our system,
00:43 not just for a single project.
00:45 So "git config --global user.name"
00:49 and I am just going to give it my normal human name, Matt Makai.
00:55 Now if you don't get any output back, that's good,
00:57 that means that everything went smoothly.
01:00 With the next command, we are going to set up our user email address,
01:04 now this is super helpful when for example we commit code
01:08 and we are working on a large project, we are working on an open source project,
01:11 maybe with people we don't necessarily know
01:13 and then they need to get in contact with us.
01:16 Now on our own businesses that may not be a big deal,
01:19 but if you hire contractors, you are going to want to know
01:22 who you should contact in case anything goes wrong.
01:25 So for this we are going to say "git config --global" again, "user"
01:29 and instead of name we are going to say "user.email".
01:32 And in my case, this is just matthew.makai@gmail.com.
01:37 Now again, no output is good, that means it's saved properly.
01:41 And we'll check it in just a moment;
01:42 now the third thing we want to run, and this is optional,
01:46 but I always set this, I set my editor,
01:50 now by default, typically Nano is the editor that pops up, but I use Vim.
01:55 And again, if you are using Sublime Text, what you can do on your own system is
01:59 set the path to the executable, so a little pop up with the Sublime Text editor
02:03 whenever you need to commit some text
02:07 or you need to write some text that Git will interpret.
02:10 We'll get into that a little bit later, but for right now,
02:12 we can set this up by saying "git config" again, "--global core.editor",
02:18 and in my case again, I am going to press specify "vim".
02:22 OK, so we've got our three things set,
02:25 we just want to double check that we've set them properly,
02:27 we can say "git config" and then just list out.
02:31 Now in my case, user.name is Matt Makai,
02:35 user.email is matthew.makai@gmail.com, and my core editor is Vim.
02:41 Obviously your setting is going to be depending upon what you set,
02:44 and again if it's a little bit confusing at this point, you don't have to worry about the editor,
02:48 but you should go ahead and set user.name and user.email.
02:51 With those few settings out of the way,
02:53 we're ready to get started and dive into using Git.

00:01 Alright, let's look inside my account on Fiverr. 
00:04 I'll show you one person that I hired for a project, 
00:07 I've actually hired two or three various things. 
00:11 Here these are also mostly graphic arts, 
00:13 like I said that is where I need the most help, 
00:15 I have the least skill and graphic arts seems like something 
00:18 that is pretty easy to get help with. 
00:21 So here you just log in, you can create a new project here, right, so post the request, 
00:26 and I posted one for a logo, for the actual business, 
00:31 the LLC that is the thing that owns the podcast and the courses, 
00:35 and this LLC is called PDX Web Properties. 
00:38 And PDX is an acronym that's been adopted for Portland Oregon, 
00:44 so it's kind of like Portland Oregon Web Properties, but you know, 
00:47 a little more concise than that, even though it's still a long name. 
00:50 So I wanted a logo for that because when I bill people on invoices, 
00:54 and I have a website, because I felt like I probably should have 
00:57 an actual presence on the web even though it's very limited, 
01:00 I should have something that looks at least a little bit established. 
01:03 So I said somebody create me a design for this, and you get a bunch of proposals, 
01:07 much more like Upwork and then you pick one and you work with that person. 
01:10 So here I said "design 3 original logo concepts for my business" and this is,
01:14 I said I am going to pay a little bit extra, I was in Europe at the time 
01:18 so they charged me in Euros, thanks for that, anyway,
01:21 I said I'll pay and instead of one design give me three and I'll pick the best one.
01:25 And then I said also, no that was five dollars, that thing, or five euros, 
01:29 but then I said I want it really quickly because I was trying to set up 
01:33 some kind of invoicing thing, there was some reason I wanted it more quickly.
01:37 So, I paid a little bit extra for that, ten bucks didn't seem like a big deal. 
01:41 You can see it was actually delivered in ten days and 23 hours, that is the countdown, 
01:45 you can say here is all the details about what I want done, 
01:49 and what was posted, this person, actualreviewnet did a good job,
01:53 so you can see over here, initially they sent me these three things,
01:56 I had sent them a few pictures about Portland, some iconic things and so on, 
01:59 like a picture of one of the volcanoes Mt Hood, 
02:03 and there is a sign that has this deer thing on it, in the city and so on. 
02:07 So they gave me back these three designs, and I said 
02:10 I kind of like this top design first, and they said well OK, 
02:13 I'll give you a few variations on that, and I didn't really like the color scheme here, 
02:18 and this seemed more energetic, so I think this is the one I ended up picking, 
02:21 you could actually check it out. 
02:25 If you go to PDX Web Properties, you can see 
02:27 here is like little landing page, and it just talks about  
02:30 "oh, we run these podcasts and the training company and there is me, we're in Portland", 
02:33 it's super simple. I just wanted something that I could put up and say 
02:38 here is the website of the business, right, 
02:41 I felt like having that logo put on invoices made it feel little more real, 
02:46 a little more professional and spending five bucks for that that seemed reasonable.

00:01 In the introduction to this chapter I showed you a job I posted. 
00:04 Let me give you a look inside Upwork, how that went. 
00:08 So here is the job, it's already closed so nobody can come apply for it, 
00:13 but this was the job I posted to have somebody help edit my podcast. 
00:18 I said I am willing to spend up to $75 on this, now since then, 
00:23 I have spent a lot more money on that because the person I hired for this one job, 
00:27 it was one podcast, actually turned out to be really good, 
00:31 and I've been using them ever since.  
00:34 And I actually pay a lot less than $75 per episode to get it edited.
00:38 OK, you can see about ten months ago it was posted, 
00:41 apparently I have 23 good reviews, five stars, 
00:44 so this is a sort of bidirectional market place; 
00:47 like I said, I can verify the people that are applying for these positions, 
00:51 they can verify that I am not some kind of crazy person, that I pay my bills, 
00:55 I am easy to work with, all these things, it works in both directions. 
00:58 So let's just scroll through and have a quick look. 
01:02 So you can put in whatever you want in the start here, 
01:05 I said look, I am going to record these episodes, here is information about the podcast,
01:08 I've been doing this myself, I would like to hire someone to do it, 
01:12 I'll share the files with you via Dropbox, things like that. 
01:16 And then I said I'd like you to do this in Audacity, 
01:20 at least maybe do it in Audacity because I am recording it,
01:25 at least at the time I was recording it in Audacity 
01:27 and I wanted to send them the files directly so they had to highest quality. 
01:31 But it turned out I am not sure if the guy in the end uses Audacity, it doesn't really matter, 
01:35 but, you get to ask specific questions, there is the section 
01:39 where you can say enter a bunch of questions and these are really important to keep the back and forth down, right, 
01:45 if  you want them to use Audacity, make sure you put a question that says 
01:47 "are you familiar with Audacity?" 
01:49 If you want to know their experience with some particular thing, put it in here, right, 
01:53 so you'll get a place where they have to basically fill out these questions 
01:56 and that be really helpful on both ends, so you can quickly look through and go yes, 
02:00 this person has skills, or the background that I need.
02:03 OK, so that is the ad. Let me show you some of the applicants. 
02:08 So over here, once you actually accept the job or give the job to one of the applicants, 
02:13 the rest of the people go into this archive, 
02:17 so I posted a job, you can see a couple of people withdrew their applications, 
02:20 that doesn't really matter, but look at this, we have 71 applicants, 
02:25 and those are the people I didn't hire, and the two that withdrew 
02:28 I think they withdrew when they saw that the job was closed. 
02:31 So, we had 73 people, really 74 apply for this job, 
02:34 that was really surprising to me how many people were willing to come work on this project,
02:39 and if you have 74 people apply for a job with lots of background information and whatnot,
02:46 there is a good chance that that is going to workout well, 
02:50 and if it didn't workout well, right, suppose I hired this guy and he for some reason
02:54 didn't workout, didn't do a good job or was slow or whatever, 
02:58 there is 73 other people I could come and then pick for the next round, 
03:02 so one of my pieces of advice to you is start small, 
03:06 in little small pieces and that lets you both build trust with each other.

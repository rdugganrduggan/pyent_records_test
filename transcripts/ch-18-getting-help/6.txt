00:01 Let's talk about graphic design.
00:05 So, there are many design agencies out there, 
00:09 one of the things I think can be really tricky 
00:13 is how do I go find somebody to do design?
00:15 because if you find someone and then you don't really like their style,
00:18 or you work with them for a week and what you get back 
00:21 is not really what you were hoping for, that can be really frustrating 
00:24 and it could be expensive as well, but not just expensive in money, but in time, right? 
00:29 You are looking to get your stuff going, you spend two weeks going that one path, 
00:32 you need to just start over, find a new person and so on. 
00:35 So let me tell you about this place called 99designs,
00:38 so I've used 99designs twice, yes, twice I've used them, maybe three times, 
00:43 I can't remember, but I've used them at least twice for various projects that I've had going.
00:48 And, one of them is for my most recent podcast, 
00:51 and I am going to take you on a tour of that, but the idea of 99designs is 
00:55 you go and you say "these are the kind of designs I like, 
00:58 here is what my project is about", 
01:01 and give them a little extra background information and so on. 
01:04 And then, you post the job here and a little bit like you saw on Upwork, 
01:08 people will go and apply to do your design. 
01:12 But, they actually submit the design that is the final product. 
01:16 They say 99 designs as in like 99 designers will submit their design to you, 
01:21 and then you just pick the final product that you like. 
01:24 When I did it I had fewer than 99 designs,
01:28 but that is because I cancelled the whole thing sooner, as I'll show you. 
01:31 This is really low risk, you get a bunch of great responses and choices
01:38 within just a few days. 
01:40 And so I am a big fan of 99designs and what you get out of it, 
01:43 it is a little rough and a bunch of designers actually put in a bunch of work 
01:47 to create designs for you and you can only pick one.

00:01 So Anthony Pukal, he is one of the guys that applied
00:03 and he seems like a really nice guy, he said I'll do this for 65 dollars. 
00:07 And you get all sorts of history about him, he's done 20 jobs, 
00:11 worked almost a 1000 hours, he's had a great success, he is top rated, these are all good things. 
00:15 Here you can see his part of that cover letter, 
00:17 these are the questions that I asked, are you familiar with Audacity? 
00:22 "No, I use Adobe Audition, here is my experience, I produced over 250 hours of podcasts 
00:27 and I worked with O'Reilly on some various projects", etc, etc, 
00:31 so he is really clearly qualified to do this work, right, 
00:35 he has many hours of experience of doing this. 
00:39 And, then he says look, here is a personal letter, 
00:42 here is another thing that I would say is very important when you are hiring people, 
00:45 is attention to detail, and make sure that they are actually responding to you, 
00:49 not just sending some like cover letter that is like completely generic.
00:53 If somebody sent me a message and it just says 
00:56 "Hi, I edit podcasts and this is my experience, thank you", 
01:01 that person immediately gets kicked out. 
01:04 On the other hand, if they send me a message, 
01:06 "Hi Michael, I listen to your podcast, it sounds really amazing, 
01:09 I think I can make it sound at least that good, I've been editing like this, 
01:13 I've been doing all this work," here you can see, look at this,
01:16 "In episode 19 you mentioned..." like, that is really,
01:20 the guy looked at what I am doing, and he is really interested and so on, 
01:25 so this to me, this is very important that there is something that shows
01:29 they have actually looked at what you've done 
01:31 and they are excited to work with you and they know what that work means. 
01:34 Finally, if you go to the bottom, you can see his work, right, 
01:38 it says work history and feedback, 
01:40 you can sort it by highest, lowest rated, whatever, 
01:42 one of the things that I also look for is how much the jobs that they have been doing,
01:48 specifically apply to the job that I am asking for, 
01:51 so if somebody is applying to say edit video, 
01:55 but they are actually, most of their jobs have been like virtual assistant 
01:58 or something weird like that, they are out. 
02:01 Like I'm looking for somebody who is a video editor, 
02:04 not a personal assistant who is like hey, I bet I could pick this thing up, right, 
02:07 so you can tell that really quickly, down here you can see things like podcast editing, 
02:11 "he is a top guy he produces great quality", "he made my life simple" 
02:15 these are all really good things, right, great experience. 
02:19 So, you can really see this before you even interact with the person, OK. 
02:24 The other thing that point out is this guy is in the US, so he is near my time zone, 
02:28 he is native English speaker, that may or may not matter, right, 
02:32 depending on what you are doing, it may or may not matter. 
02:36 So here is another guy, from Greece, and he says "I'll do the same job for 30 bucks".
02:42 And he is also top rated, extremely high success rate, lots of history on Upwork, 
02:48 so that really helps, again if you look at the cover letter, 
02:51 he answers the questions well, 
02:53 "yeah, I use Audacity" but mostly just as sort of a transfer format, 
02:57 this is usually what I work in, here is my experience, 
03:01 eight years I've worked at the Greek Broadcasting Company, 
03:06 doing interviews and radio dramas, 
03:09 I mean, this guy has got serious professional TV and radio type of work, 
03:14 so you can come down here, now notice, 
03:17 if you look at this, there is no personal stuff. 
03:21 There is no "Hey Michael, I check out your podcast, this is really great, etc etc etc" 
03:25 but at least there is some comment about what I sent over, so that is pretty good. 
03:30 And then, if you go and look at his work history, 
03:32 he is extraordinaire at what he does, we can count on him, 
03:37 and he doesn't disappoint, right, there is all sorts of reviews like that, 
03:40 so this guys is definitely in the running as well.
03:43 Right, so from then on I might start a conversation with them, you can send messages. 
03:47 In the end, it's one job, one week, 30 bucks, 50 bucks, 
03:52 it's not a tremendous commitment, 
03:55 so you can try somebody out and if it works out well then you keep working with them, 
03:58 if it doesn't work out well, well- you learn something and you move on.

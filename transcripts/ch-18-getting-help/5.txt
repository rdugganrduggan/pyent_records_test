00:01 A final thought about Upwork before I go, 
00:03 I've had really good success with things like this, 
00:06 help me edit my podcast, help me create transcripts for my online courses, 
00:10 I have a really great women named Marija who does that for me, 
00:14 who I also found through Upwork and we've been working together 
00:16 for almost two years; this experience has been super.  
00:20 I have tried to hire somebody through here for web development 
00:23 and I tried to hire somebody for a software development job, 
00:28 and I found those to be much, much more sketchy. I don't know why, 
00:32 maybe it's just because software jobs are in demand 
00:35 and everyone is trying to jump on the bandwagon or something, 
00:38 but, I've interviewed people where they claimed to be in different location 
00:43 then they actually were, they lied about their history, things like that,
00:48 so for example there is a guy I think he was from the Philippines 
00:52 who said he was in Chicago, or somewhere like that. 
00:56 And, I don't remember how I figured that out, 
00:59 I think it was through like real time Google analytics
01:04 and I said "Where are you right now?", "I am in Chicago", 
01:06 OK, go to these various webpages on my website, 
01:09 not because I was trying to test him, but I was a little unsure, 
01:14 but really wanted to show him those things there and I happen to have my analytics up 
01:17 and I look over and it says on this page, one visitor from the Philippines. 
01:22 It's totally fine with me if someone is from the Philippines, I don't care, 
01:25 like I hire people from a bunch of places
01:28 and I would be more than happy to work with someone from the Philippines, 
01:31 but not someone from the Philippines who is lying and saying they are in Chicago. 
01:35 Be a little careful if it actually comes to software development, web design, 
01:38 those seem to attract folks that are trying to find they way into the industry I guess, 
01:43 I don't know, that's my one word of caution here.

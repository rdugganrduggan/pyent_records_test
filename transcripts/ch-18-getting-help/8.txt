00:01 Next up is Fiverr. 
00:04 And, If you looked at 99designs and you are like "wow, that is expensive", 
00:08 700 dollars for like a logo, and, I think it is expensive but, 
00:12 like I said, I felt like it was worth it, and you want to start smaller, 
00:16 which is totally something I would recommend, 
00:19 if you want to start smaller, than you can go to Fiverr. 
00:22 Now, Fiverr, the name, I believe comes from the fact
00:26 that you pay five dollars for a thing, and the prices really are pretty close to that, 
00:31 so I'll give you a look inside of one of the projects or things I did over Fiverr. 
00:37 But here you can find much smaller projects, 
00:39 much cheaper but at the same time, I would say, 
00:43 obviously if you pay five dollars for a thing versus 50 dollars on say Upwork 
00:49 versus 700 dollars on 99designs, 
00:52 you are going to get a verity of different skill levels, and effort put into it and so on.
00:58 Fiverr is pretty cool for really small things, 
01:01 I haven't used it a ton, I've used it for graphic arts 
01:05 but you can use it for all sorts of things.

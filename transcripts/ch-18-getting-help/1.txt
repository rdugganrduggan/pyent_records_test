00:02 Let's talk about getting help. 
00:06 We are going to talk about when and where you should get help with your business. 
00:10 Now, this is not me recommending you go hire a bunch of people 
00:13 but just to think strategically about your time 
00:16 and when it makes sense to get some help here and there; 
00:19 then I'll show you some really great ways to do that. 
00:22 So we're going to look at a place called Upwork, 
00:25 although there are few other options, Upwork is a really good place to find 
00:28 short term and even long term, but sporadic work type of consultance 
00:34 for a whole variety of different things.
00:37 We're going to talk about Fiverr which is a place where you can get all sorts of stuff done,
00:41 graphics and other little tasks done for like $5, $10, 
00:46 I think that's where the name comes from. 
00:48 We'll talk about getting help with design, and what Fiverr and Upwork 
00:52 both would apply to that, we're going to look at a place called 99designs 
00:56 which is a low risk way for you to get this done. 
01:00 When you think about getting help, these are the standard ways you might get help 
01:03 with your business, graphics, other sorts of consulting and so on, 
01:07 even household chores are in the game here, under consideration. 
01:11 So think of it like this, if you spend let's say ten, twenty hours a week 
01:15 doing things like cleaning up the house, mowing the lawn, 
01:18 racking the leaves, all of these types of things, well, 
01:22 you maybe don't have a bunch of money because 
01:24 hey you are trying to start your own business, and you are just getting started, 
01:28 it still may make sense to think of ways to be creative and try to juggle your time differently.
01:35 So let's suppose that you could do let's say five hours of consulting a week, 
01:40 and just to put some numbers on, let's say you make a 100 dollars an hour 
01:44 doing consulting for five hours a week. 
01:47 If you take five hours that you would have focused on your business 
01:51 and did five hours consulting but then took that money and applied it to free you up
01:55 all the other things so you don't have to mow the lawn,
01:58 you don't have to clean the house, things like that, 
02:01 maybe you could get back twenty hours, right, 
02:04 because obviously you don't pay people a 100 dollars an hour to mow the lawn. 
02:07 So the whole idea is just be creative about how you spend your time and energy 
02:14 and where it makes sense- get help.
02:17 In this chapter, I am going to show you some really concrete ways to do that. 
02:21 Let me leave you with a brief story. 
02:23 So on the very first day that I was 100% independent,
02:28 I was no longer employed as a full time employee, but I decided to quit, 
02:32 start focusing 100% on the podcast, 
02:35 and knowing that part of that time is going to be spent building classes exactly like this one.
02:40 On my first day literally, I quit, well my last day at work was February 15th, 
02:47 so first thing I did, first thing in the morning when I started working 
02:51 100% on my own projects was I went and I posted an ad to get help with my podcast. 
02:56 I was spending two to four hours a week editing the audio 
03:00 and I had been doing that for six months, nine months, something like that, 
03:04 I decided I needed as much free time as I can get to focus on growing this business, 
03:09 on doing more things like these online courses, 
03:12 so I went and I posted an ad on Upwork, specifically I posted this ad. 
03:17 You can see that was about ten months ago. 
03:19 Since then, I've hired more people through Upwork, 
03:21 I've done things on 99designs, I've done things on Fiverr 
03:24 and so on but the message is I decided that my time was more well spent 
03:29 focusing on the future and I could actually backfill this money 
03:33 and make more money if I had more time. 
03:36 Now that's a really careful thing you want to balance, right?
03:39 I had been doing this work for a long time, I knew exactly how much effort it was, 
03:42 and I wasn't speculating I would need people to get help but I specifically knew 
03:46 here is two to three hours I could get back, those two or three hours a week 
03:50 will certainly pay dividends if I can rework my schedule. 
03:53 So, throughout this chapter we are going to talk about 
03:56 the various places you can get help, 
03:59 when you should and maybe shouldn't get help.

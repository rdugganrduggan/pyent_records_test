00:02 Let's talk about layout and a common look and feel. 
00:06 Obviously, we would like to have one place to maintain 
00:09 the look and feel of our application, 
00:11 we'd like to have the overall look and feel of the site easily adapted 
00:15 and brought into every single page that we create 
00:18 and if we had a new page, we want to be able to do that super easily 
00:22 as well as if we want to make changes like 
00:24 here I have a little "brought to you by H I R E D" thing on my podcast, 
00:28 what if I want to change that? I'd like to be able to change that in one place 
00:31 and have everything just take that look and feel, 
00:34 what if I want to switch it to a whiteish rather than a dark colored site; 
00:37 I want to be able to do that in one place, similar with navigation, everything. 
00:41 The mechanism by which we accomplish this is shared layout. 
00:45 And I want to point out while it's most obvious that 
00:48 this is about the look and feel of our site, there is more to it than that, 
00:51 a modern web application is very important to have the same 
00:55 consistent information in all of our site, things like what is the fav icon, 
01:00 what is the description, is there an RSS feed, where is it, 
01:03 all that kind of stuff is important.
01:06 It's very important that we consistently bring CSS files 
01:10 all the CSS files in the right order into the page, 
01:13 it's also important to bring the right JavaScript files into the page and again, in the right order.
01:18 Of course we want to do this in one place, so we want to make a change it flows through, 
01:21 but it's also just very important to know 
01:24 that we are controlling that absolutely consistently across our site. 
01:27 We want to have consistent analytics, so we might have Google analytics, 
01:32 maybe Facebook pixels for trying to do Facebook ads, 
01:36 and we want to track conversions, 
01:38 all those kinds of things you again want to be able to put that in a shared layout 
01:42 and have that flow or change throughout your site all at once
01:46 we also want to have structured ways for the individual pages 
01:49 to bring in additional CSS and JavaScript. 
01:53 For example maybe you've got some page 
01:54 that is kind of a single page app thing and you want to bring in AngularJS, 
01:58 you'd like to have a way for that an individual page 
02:02 to consistently bring in the additional JavaScript and CSS that it's going to need, 
02:06 and weave that into your overall look and feel and JavaScript ordering and so on, 
02:11 and we can use our shared layout to control this aspect as well.

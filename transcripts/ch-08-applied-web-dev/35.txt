 00:01 Let's review HTML 5 validation. 
00:06 So there is a couple of things that we can do
00:08 to help our users understand what they should put in here. 
00:11 First of all, we've added "required", so here this is just for the sign in, 
00:15 we can say both the username and password 
00:18 or in this case email address are required 
00:21 and we can also put a placeholder to give them a little hint 
00:24 about what should be typed in there and what is required, 
00:27 and further, for certain data types like email, 
00:30 we can say the type is email and so the various browsers were validated 
00:34 at least do basic validation
00:36 like make sure that things have an @ sign and so on in them. 
00:39 And then we say type="email", we'll get nice little error messages like this, 
00:43 if I put in just "Michael", it says "you know Michael, you probably need an @sign
00:47 in that email address or it's not an email address." 
00:49 So be sure to add this to your site where possible, 
00:52 it's really easy and you get these in browser support.

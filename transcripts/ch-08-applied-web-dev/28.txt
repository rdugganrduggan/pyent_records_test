00:01 So now we have this data being passed in, 
00:02 we would do something... let's comment that out for a second, we would do something
00:07 like maybe over here we would create account in DB 
00:12 we would send welcome email,
00:15 before we did any of that of course we want to validate no account exists 
00:20 and maybe passwords match, 
00:23 although you know this confirmation business 
00:25 I know a lot of sites have it and it feels great 
00:27 but at the same time if you have a really good way to reset your password, 
00:31 then maybe we could simplify and streamline the account creation 
00:36 and maybe get just a few more percent people to actually sign up for our site, 
00:40 that would be really nice so we can decide if we want this in practice, 
00:43 but these are the types of things, 
00:44 validate that the data is OK, that they actually entered an email 
00:48 the email is valid things like this and then if it is, we'll create an account, 
00:51 I'll send a welcome email and then what we want to do is we want to redirect. 
00:56 We can just raise an exception, a specific exception type. 
01:00 Now this redirect pattern, I told you get POST/redirect is super common, 
01:05 so the ability to redirect to a URL is also something you need all the time, 
01:08 where the stuff that all the action methods need go? It goes in the base controller, 
01:13 so let's write a redirect function over here. 
01:16 So here we'll just have "def redirect", and then we'll have to_url, 
01:20 where do we want them to go?
01:22 It could be on our site, it could be somewhere else, it just depends what URL we put. 
01:26 OK, we are going to need access to this exception thing, 
01:29 so let's go over here and say import pyramid.httpexceptions 
01:34 and let's keep it a little bit short, so let's say "as exc", 
01:37 so we don't have to type out that long thing, 
01:39 and then down here we are going to actually add one more parameter, 
01:42 let's say whether let's let the user decide whether or not this is a permanent redirect,
01:47 sometimes you want to have a temporary redirect, 
01:50 like our login for example, other times, you are going to permanently do a redirect 
01:55 and this is important for SEO, we won't get into it now 
01:58 but let's go ahead and set that ability here. 
02:00 So we are going to return or cause one of two types of exceptions, 
02:04 we'll say "if permanent", we want to raise our exc.HTTPMovedPermanently. 
02:11 Now notice we can set the location, we can set the details, the headers, comments, 
02:16 all sorts of stuff but we are just going to say the location is the to_url. 
02:21 But if it's not permanent, we are going to raise the different type of exception, 
02:24 HTTPFound, so I know you are looking for this but I found it over there 
02:28 so go redirect over to this to_url. 
02:32 So PyCharm is still in this, this can be static, let's just tell it, hey don't bother me. 
02:37 Don't make it look like there is something wrong with this, 
02:39 so back to our account controller, we're ready to redirect, 
02:42 assuming that we get through all this validation, 
02:44 we don't have to return anything, we can just say self.redirect because remember, 
02:48 this throws an exception, where are we going to go?
02:50 Let's just go to /account. 
02:53 And this is not going to be a permanent redirect, this is just when you log in. 
02:57 So, let's do this, we can put this back for a minute, 
03:01 and we can print out redirecting, alright, 
03:04 so we pretty much have the GET/POST/redirect thing in place, 
03:07 and here is the GET, the user is going to post it back, the post is going to hit this one, 
03:11 we'll do the various work, which we are not doing the validation yet, 
03:14 we'll do that in just a moment, then we are going to redirect here. 
03:18 Let's rerun the app and check it out, so let's go register, 
03:21 my name is going to be "jeff", the password is going to be "a", again "a", hit Enter, 
03:27 calling this we have two passwords, redirecting our account page and where are we? 
03:31 We are now on /account, not /account/register, just /account, 
03:34 because guess what we register for the site, how awesome is that? 
03:37 Ok, last thing we are going to talk about after this is 
03:41 how do we add a little basically temporary validation 
03:43 and we'll see a pattern that makes all of this cleaner.

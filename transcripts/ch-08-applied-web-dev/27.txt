00:01 So we've wired up our form through the register page 
00:04 and it calls the GET version when we do an initial load 
00:08 and it calls this post version when we submit the form. 
00:11 So this is really nice, it lets us separate the data access 
00:14 and various things we do to initially populate the form 
00:17 from the thing we actually do to process the request. 
00:21 In this case that's the request to register for the site. 
00:24 now the next question is well, how do I get the data they gave us from over here? 
00:29 We had an email and we had a password and we had confirm password. 
00:33 How do we get that? 
00:36 So over here we are going to go to the request, 
00:39 now the request was stored by the base controller onto this class, 
00:44 so we can just say self.request and there is a way to access the post data, 
00:48 there is a way to access the query strings, 
00:51 there is a way to access the routes
00:54 and all of those can communicate data to this method, 
00:57 so for now we are just going to focus on POST 
00:59 and later we'll look at the way to unify this 
01:01 and sort of forget this is ever a decision you make,
01:04 where did the data come from, for example. 
01:06 So, on the request object, there is a POST dictionary, 
01:10 standard, more or less standard, 
01:11 it's a multidict but a standard dictionary type of access, 
01:14 so we want to get a hold of the email, and the best way to do it is to use the GET, 
01:19 because if for some reason this field or this key is missing from this POST, 
01:25 it will crash the site if we don't do a GET, 
01:27 if we just do ('email'), but this will just make it Null 
01:30 if it's not there, so we want to do this again for a few things. 
01:33 OK and let's just print this out just to see that the data is getting here, 
01:38 we are not going to do anything with it yet, but we'll print out the data. 
01:44 This is going to be jeff@jeff.com, password is going to be the letter "a", 
01:51 this is going to be also the letter "a", 
01:54 let's register so we get "oh would you like to save this?" 
01:58 Not right now, check this out, we've passed our data in, 
02:02 it's jeff and I made this mismatch here just to be silly, 
02:05 a little lowercase "a" and uppercase "A", 
02:08 so this is how we get the data passed over 
02:10 let's pull this up so you see it together, 
02:12 anytime we post the data, it just gets stored in this POST dictionary,
02:15 which we can access however we want to do with dictionary access.

0:01 Let's review some of the options we have for mapping action methods on controllers. 
0:06 So here you can see we have a HomeController, it has a pyramid_handlers.action decorator on an index. 
0:14 Now, this one allows... this particular action method is actually 
0:18 processing a form post on the home page. 
0:23 So if maybe on your homepage you put a form that has a place 
0:28 for like an email address and a button that says "hey, sign up for my newsletter", 
0:31 this would receive the email address and actually put them in your newsletter, 
0:35 there is very likely a corresponding GET version that shows the homepage 
0:39 and that form and so on. 
0:41 So over here you can see that we can set the renderer,
0:44 this is probably something you are going to do almost all the time, 
0:47 you want to pick some kind of file convention 
0:49 I've shown you my templates/controller name
0:52 directory/action name file convention and that works very well for me, 
0:58 so we are going to specify this here and then notice, 
1:00 we are actually setting the request method, so this method will only be called 
1:04 if there is an HTTP post to that URL that we've mapped it to, 
1:08 if there is a GET, there is some other not-shown method that is run, 
1:11 so here we can filter by request method, 
1:14 in Python you can't have method overloading by parameter, 
1:19 there is only one method with the given name in any given class 
1:22 or outside of any given class in a particular module. 
1:25 So we can't have like index and then have some parameters 
1:29 and then an index and a get, so here we are actually setting the name 
1:33 to allow us to have an index_post and an index_get.

00:01 Maybe a little CSS will have to work, so how do we style this? 
00:04 Let's go look at the page source - look how nice and clean this is, first of all, 
00:08 so this little block that we were working with that has the class, 
00:12 the whole thing got duplicated each time 
00:15 so we can just style album and class image in CSS, let's go do that. 
00:26 So here is our style, we can come over here and let's start by going down, 
00:30 we'll figure out some other stuff to put in there in a minute 
00:33 but we want to style the image 
00:34 and let's say the height is always going to be 1.50 px regardless how wide it is, 
00:40 maybe it would be better to match the width 
00:42 but let's see what we get - that looks pretty nice, 
00:46 and here we have that and maybe we want to actually have this thing 
00:52 float left and of course we've got to reset it, remember,
00:57 we come here, so clear both should set that across and the padding, 
01:07 padding doesn't look so amazing to me, what do you think?
01:10 How about we add some padding on a margin rather, here set that at 10 px. 
01:16 Here we go, alright, and finally, square, squares may be good squares may be bad, 
01:21 let's do one more thing, import a radius 5 px, just to little round it off bit there.
01:27 Ok, so I kind of like this, so we're going to stick with this, 
01:30 with the Year of the Snake maybe we also want to show the tracks here, 
01:33 so we could go do that, and down here we'll just do something like 
01:43 UL and we want some LIs in here so we can come down here 
01:47 and say tal, again "repeat", "t in a.tracks", and then the text, 
01:54 I'll just make this "t.title", they both have titles. 
01:58 Oops, I always do this, I always say "in", and "in" is not the syntax, 
02:02 it's just variable and then the set. 
02:04 So there we go, we've got this, I am starting to not like the float thing so much here
02:09 but that's OK, let's change this form an H2 to a div with a class="album-title" 
02:16 and do a little style on that. 
02:20 And we'll just set the font size to like 18 pixels or something 
02:23 there is a lot of padding that goes on with those pieces, 
02:26 with the headers, OK, that's alright, and while we're at it, 
02:31 let's do one more thing, let's put this free, this preview over by the title. 
02:36 Here we go, and I think that looks not great, 
02:40 but I don't want to spend too much time doing design,
02:42 let's go over here and just put a little spacing on those things,
02:47 and let's go and add margin right, a little bit bigger 
02:49 so our bullet points stand out a little bit more. 
02:52 OK, so you can see that we've done a little bit of work with our templates, 
02:56 we've gotten the title, we've done some looping, 
02:59 now we've obviously done some styles, there is nothing about the template there 
03:02 but the way it nicely carries on with the classes and so on, that definitely works well. 
03:06 So, let's look at this preview, now if we look at our data, 
03:11 the first one has the preview, 
03:14 the second one has no preview, so how do we know, 
03:17 how do we control the templating to say "only show this if that thing is True or False"? 
03:22 So this is really easy in tal, err... in Chameleon, 
03:26 so we come over and say tal:condition, and we just set the value, 
03:29 so we are looping over albums for each album we want to know 
03:32 whether it has the preview, we do it like this. 
03:35 Notice, the preview went away on the one that does not have the preview, 
03:39 how cool is that? Alright, so things are looking pretty good over here, 
03:42 we've got our data passed in, it's flowing down here, we're rendering it really well, 
03:47 granted we are not going to do much styling yet, 
03:50 I am going to wait until we get to the front-end framework parts 
03:53 before we really go all in on making this beautiful and whatnot. 
03:56 So let's consider this temporarily good enough.

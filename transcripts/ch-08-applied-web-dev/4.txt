0:01 Let’s get started with these handlers. 
0:03 Well, the first thing we have to do is to "pip install" them,  
0:06 they are an external package that doesn't come by default with the scaffold, 
0:09 so we are going to go install it. 
0:12 Now, there are a couple of way in which we can install it, 
0:14 I'll show you a third way that is good for now 
0:16 but also a little more helpful when we get to the deployment stage of things. 
0:20 So we could "pip install" using the package manager in PyCharm, 
0:25 so if you hit Command+, on OS10, that is "settings" in basically any OS10 app, 
0:30 you just go to the settings, project interpreter you can see there is no in here, 
0:33 there is no Pyramid handlers, so we can easily add that, 
0:39 go over here and just say pyramid_handlers and pick that, 
0:43 and see, written by Chris McDonough, 
0:46 here is how I could just click this button, "boom, installed". 
0:49 So that's a good start, the other thing we could do is go over to terminal 
0:53 and activate our virtual environment that we are using, 
0:56 so once we've activated it, we could "pip install pyramid_handlers", 
1:05 I could hit Enter there and that would work, 
1:08 but neither these help tell the deployment system: 
1:11 "Hey, in order to run this web app you are going to need Pyramid handlers." 
1:14 So if we go over here to the setup.py, remember, 
1:17 a Pyramid web apps are a Python packages, they have requirements, 
1:22 so we could come over here and say you know what, we have a new requirement, 
1:25 we are going to use Pyramid handlers. 
1:28 And right away, PyCharm says oh, you have some requirement that is not satisfied, 
1:32 I could click this or I could just go "Tools, Run setup.py..." 
1:37 and I guess I'll do it this way, "develop", just to show you,
1:41 it's easy to see how to click the button. 
1:44 So if I run this, it will realize "oh, we need this Pyramid handlers" 
1:46 and you can see now the requirement installation dialog went away,
1:50 because we just installed that along with verifying we have everything else 
1:53 but of course, we've been running this throughout the whole course, 
1:56 everything else was already there.
1:58 Now one final thing to use Pyramid handlers in our web app
2:03 is to add a "config include pyramid_hanlders", so
2:08 Pyramid actually loads that up and that will make it possible for us to call
2:11 "config.add_handler" in addition to or instead of "config.add_route".
2:19 Now let's go and run this just to make sure everything is hanging together correctly, 
2:23 and it looks like it is, pull the website up, and there we have it, 
2:27 still looks more or less like the starter scaffold, 
2:29 but we are going to address that pretty soon.

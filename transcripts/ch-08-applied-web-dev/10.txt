0:02 As you've seen, creating a base controller, 
0:06 some kind of class that all of our controllers derive from,
0:08 allows us to centralize a lot of shared functionality. 
0:12 First of all, we no longer need to define a dunder init 
0:15 that grabs the request, which is a requirement for all the controllers, 
0:19 it also lets us set things like that cache busting utility, 
0:22 making that available to all the views
0:24 and here you can see we are setting a page title 
0:27 that means we can go into our templates 
0:30 and say I'd like to set the title to view.page_title.
0:34 And things it derive from the controller base, if they want to change the title,
0:37 they can just set the title to something else before it gets rendered. 
0:40 But this way every template and as you'll see, the shared master template later, 
0:45 will be able to rely on this field being there. 
0:48 We also can set properties to say 
0:50 "is this a get request or a post request?" and simplify that, 
0:53 here you can see we even gave a set_title function 
0:57 that will let us define a common ending for the title of our web app 
1:01 that let us specify some little prefix 
1:04 like your account-my web app, things like that,

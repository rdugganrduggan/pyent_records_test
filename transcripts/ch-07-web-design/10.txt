0:02 So let's talk about CSS selectors as a concept;
0:05 we've seen that you can select by type, 
0:07 so we can start out with this site.css file here 
0:10 and we can select my HTML node, so a body, div etc,
0:15 we can select by CSS class that's . (dot) 
0:19 so here we want all things that have the lead class, 
0:21 which would be including this paragraph up here, 
0:24 or we would say I want all the divs that are main, right, 
0:28 so there might be other things that are main 
0:30 but we are targeting the divs that have the class main. 
0:33 And we could also select by id, so here we are saying 
0:36 I'd like the image that is the profile image, 
0:38 or I'd like to go to a div and get to the profile section 
0:41 and do whatever we are going to do with that. 
0:44 We've seen in our little demo app how we can combine these 
0:47 into a hierarchy, so we can say things like: "I want to go to the table, 
0:50 get the table row, and it has the class .this_month, so the class this_month, 
0:54 and here we are setting that to be yellow."
0:57 We can even use this greater than sign, this angle bracket to say table angle bracket row 
1:01 so I only want the table rows that are immediately contained within the table, 
1:05 I think in the example that we have here we have a table body,
1:09 so this would return no rows, the second statement here. 
1:13 And we also played around with the idea of inheritance and specialization, 
1:16 so we have this content thing, and notice we are setting the padding 
1:20 and the line height and then we have a more specialized version 
1:24 a content, which is also a lead and this will take precedence over just plain content, 
1:29 there is actually kind of a order of operators 
1:32 like you have in programming languages or math, equations, 
1:35 things like that around what is more specific and what is less specific 
1:39 for example an id is more specific than a class. 
1:42 But nonetheless, we have this content, which is more specialized 
1:45 as a content lead and we have a regular content. 
1:49 So notice we have the padding and that padding is actually overwritten 
1:52 in the lead to be 30, the font size we are setting, because it's just unset in content 
1:58 but the line height we are not overwriting with the specialization 
2:01 so the thing that we end up with has basically padding of 30, 
2:06 the fonts size of 18 pixels and the line height of 1.25em.

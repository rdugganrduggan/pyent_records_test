 0:01 Let's jump over here to PyCharm and have a look at the web application 
0:03 that we are going to be using to explore web design. 
0:07 So, I decided to take just a basic empty shell from the Pyramid starter project, 
0:13 which does include Bootstrap but really basically nothing else, 
0:16 and strip it down to just its essence. 
0:19 So, I wanted to keep the content and styles in play at the very minimum 
0:25 so let me go and run this, and show you what we got. 
0:30 So over here we've got our design foundations demo app 
0:33 and you can see we have a thing for style sheets and caching, CSS selectors, 
0:38 we look at box model layout and floating items. 
0:41 So the part we are focused on right now is this cache busting and stale caches, 
0:46 so check this out, if I click here you can this is just going to refresh this page, 
0:49 it's as if I came back to it, same thing is if I go up here and hit enter, 
0:53 it's just going to reload this page, 
0:55 so let's go make a very trivial change to the style sheets affecting this app. 
1:00 First of all, notice we've created a style sheet static/css/site.css in our static folder,
1:08 remember we have Bootstrap and some other things installed in Bower, 
1:11 so I replicated that in our little demo app 
1:14 and I made the CSS folder and image and a js folder. 
1:18 So over here, I've made a variety of CSS for the various demos 
1:23 that we are going to work with, theme and site are used across everything 
1:26 and then these are specialized little changes that we are adding on. 
1:29 We'll get to those later, but for now, notice we are including site.css 
1:33 in the index page, and over here we've got some colors. 
1:37 Now, let's change a color, see it's black on white, what if we want to change the color? 
1:42 Now this is pretty cool, check this out in PyCharm, 
1:45 notice there is a black thing on the left and if I hit Alt+Enter 
1:47 it will say: "Hey, you can change the color, what do you want the color to be?
1:50 Pick something that you've recently worked with, or whatever." Right, 
1:54 so this lets you go and say you know what, 
1:56 I kind of like this green, maybe we'll use this green here. 
1:59 And of course, green is not going to be lovely, what are we trying to set? 
2:03 We are trying to set the color, so let's set the color to like a cyan, 
2:07 not quite cyan but close enough. 
2:11 And then let's come over here and set the color instead of this being white 
2:14 let's set it to something black, like right around there, that's good enough black. Choose.
2:20 OK, I am going to save, Command+S, you can see the little presenter tip, saved every file, 
2:27 now if I come back over here, and I am like: "All right, 
2:31 I just changed, let's move this aside, 
2:34 I just changed the color from black to cyan
2:39 and I changed the background from white to basically black." 
2:43 And you would think if I come over here and I visit this page, 
2:48 that I would see a black background with cyan text, but wait. 
2:53 What? What is this? Like it's white and if I click around, it's white, 
2:58 if I click around, I click on here, I navigate over this page, 
3:01 oh, now on this page - look! It finally changed, but now it's gone again, 
3:05 if I do a force refresh then look, cyan-color text, well, 
3:10 cyan-ish-color text and a black background. 
3:14 Finally that change took hold. 
3:16 This doesn't happen very often in development, if you set things up correctly. 
3:21 But, in production, this happens all the time, you actually want this to happen,
3:25 you want the browsers not to download the CSS and the images and everything, 
3:30 except for one time ever, like that would be ideal if it never ever downloaded it again,
3:35 because that means when people visit your site or more importantly 
3:39 when they got to like the second page, it's instantly got all the images,
3:43 all the CSS, all the JavaScript, and it doesn't ever go back to your site to pull that in. 
3:47 So we want to aggressively cache things 
3:51 but you can see there are these problems it introduces,
3:54 now, I said you don't run into that problem as much, 
3:57 when you are running in development,
3:59 so if I go over here, you see it's still white but if I force refresh it, it goes, 
4:03 sorry it was still black, but is I force refresh it, it goes to white. 
4:06 Now notice, over here that I am running the production version, 
4:10 let me check out the run configurations I've made, 
4:13 one of them is running production.ini and the other one is running development.ini,
4:18 so normally, you are going to be running development and when you do that locally, 
4:22 you are going to most of the time not run into this caching problem, 
4:27 you are still going to run into it and like I said, 
4:29 it's worse around JavaScript but it's not as bad. 
4:32 But in production, it's going to be a problem for your users, 
4:35 and so we might as well solve it now at the beginning, 
4:38 and we won't run into it ever in development and our users won't either.

 0:02 Let's return to our design web app. 
0:04 Here we have a very basic set of HTML, we have a top div 
0:08 and within we have two things, we have - this is a message 
0:10 and we have some dunecat picture, whatever that looks like. 
0:14 And then we have a paragraph, 
0:16 the idea is that this is kind of be a navigational bit at the top, 
0:19 and here this is going to be the content of the page. 
0:22 OK, so let's just see what it looks like, here we go, 
0:26 I applied a few styles to make the fonts bigger, to shrink the dunecat, 
0:30 here you can see "I are dunecat, I controls the spice, I controls the universe." Beautiful, 
0:35 so if you have read the book Dune, this is a great little worm cat there.
0:40 And notice, we have this message, we have this cat, 
0:43 what I would like to see is I'd like to see this message here
0:46 and this part sort of scaled a stretch and this cat the stick in the upper right. 
0:50 So, how do we do that? 
0:52 Let's go over here and the way that you do this, 
0:55 the way you say "I want the thing to stick to a side", is 
0:58 you say there is a couple of options, to create layout among them. 
1:01 but here let's say we would like this thing this image, 
1:05 now because there is only one image on the whole page 
1:07 I can just use just the image type, but we probably want to be specific,
1:11 I come over here and we say "float", and now "float..." you have a couple of options, 
1:16 you have "none", which is standard, you have "left" and you have "right". 
1:20 So we'll pick right, that sounds good, 
1:22 now this is not kind of do quite what we expected, 
1:25 there is a couple of problems here, one is the order of these things 
1:28 and the other is this container, the black thing, 
1:32 if we look at the black thing before I run this is this, 
1:34 and it contains the div and it contains the image. 
1:37 But when I run this, now all of the sudden the dunecat is shooting out the bottom 
1:41 and the main content is wrapping around it, OK that's bizzare, 
1:45 why is it not like at least lined up with this vertically, 
1:48 we wanted to go to the right of that thing. 
1:51 Well, in HTML, the way it works, the thing you would like to float- let me rephrase, 
1:58 the thing you want to wrap around it goes after the thing that is floating. 
2:02 So in order to get that to work right, we've got to say the things that floats first
2:06 and then the various pieces that go around it, 
2:08 so let's look at this again, there you go, that's better, 
2:11 at least they are kind of visually lined up on the top there. 
2:14 But, what is the deal with this wrapping around it, well, that's because it's float, 
2:19 but why does it not stay in this box here? 
2:21 The reason is, we need to tell the content of this, 
2:25 we need to tell basically the browser that this stuff is all suppose to wrap around it
2:30 but everything after that, is not, it's suppose to go back to normal layout, 
2:34 so there is a "anti-float", if you will, that we can set here, 
2:38 and we can put more or less any HTML item here but a div is like zero height 
2:43 if it has no content, so this is decent, 
2:45 and the way you stop this floating is you say:  
2:49 "OK, here is the end of the stuff that wraps, 
2:52 now make a new line" as you say "clear: both". 
2:55 We could technically just say "clear: left" but let's just say clear both, 
2:58 that'll cover both cases; 
3:00 so if I go over here and I refresh, now it should go back 
3:03 to exactly what you would probably have thought we got in the first place.
3:07 Perfect, now of course, we've got some height to sort of line this up, 
3:11 and vertically align them but that's a whole different conversation.
3:14 So we were able to use the "float", let me just move this around a little, 
3:17 to show you the cat sticks to the side, right, 
3:20 the cat totally sticks in the upper right, 
3:22 and we can get this sort of navigational thing at the top 
3:25 and the main content to go below it. 
3:27 And we did that by setting the image to float right, 
3:32 making sure that the thing that is floating right precedes the stuff
3:35 that is supposed to float around it or wrap around it 
3:39 and then when we are done,
3:40 we have all the stuff that is supposed to wrap around, we say: "Stop this float business,
3:43 go back to normal layout" by saying "clear: both".
3:47 So we have "float" and we have "anti-float", which is "clear".

0:01 Now let's explore this thing called the CSS box model. 
0:04 Now, the box model lets you control how various items want to be placed,
0:09 next to other items, or elements on the screen.
0:13 And there is a wide variety of things that we can set and work with, 
0:16 a combination of basically margin, padding, orders, width, minimum width, 
0:21 and same for the height, as well as the display mode 
0:25 which we'll get to in the next section in layout, 
0:28 but the box model works in conjunction with this display mode or layout. 
0:33 So, we are going to  look at the box part of it then we'll look at the layout next. 
0:38 The HTML we are working with is drop dead simple, 
0:41 we have three things and these are divs, we'll change a few colors 
0:45 so that we can easily identify these pieces, and we'll go from there. 
0:48 So here is what we have, we have an outside piece, 
0:51 we have an inside piece and the inside piece contains 
0:54 a thing called "contained", and it has content.
0:57 So the thing we will focus on is this inside piece, OK, 
1:01 how is it affected for by what is inside it, 
1:05 and how does it affect its relationship with the outside as well as the contained element. 
1:10 So let's go and run this, and pull it up. 
1:16 So we are going to go to the CSS box model,
1:19 here you can see, let's go over to the CSS really quick, 
1:22 we'll see the outside piece has a gray background, so that's this piece here, 
1:27 the content piece has a black background with yellow text, 
1:31 so if we go down a little the content or the contained pieces, 
1:33 black background with yellow text. 
1:36 And then, the inside piece, is light blue, with solid red border. 
1:44 Now you don't see the inside piece, do you? 
1:47 Right now the margin is zero, the padding is zero and the border is zero
1:50 and so it basically has no other size defined for it, other than what it is containing, 
1:57 and because of the containing thing is effectively on top in z order, 
2:00 you'll never see the color of the background thing. 
2:04 And then, this gray thing here that is the full outside, 
2:07 you can see that around the edges you don't see any of that 
2:11 inside piece that holds it contained showing up. 
2:15 So let's make a few changes here, so let's set the padding to 20 pixels 
2:19 and we'll set the border and the margin to zero. 
2:23 So when we change the padding, that gives it extra space,
2:27 it has to be bigger to contain whatever it contains, so let's just do this. 
2:31 Now you actually see the blue, thing which is the inside element, 
2:33 that's the thing we are applying this box model to, 
2:36 so it's got some size, which is defined by the content that it contains, 
2:40 we could set it explicitly either through width or min width or things like that, 
2:44 but if you don't do that, it's set more or less in this current form by the thing it contains.
2:50 And then, it has to have 20 pixels extra on each side, 
2:54 so this is on the inside, now, if we wanted it the other way, 
2:58 if we wanted just to leave some room around the edges but not show through, 
3:01 not actually show the thing but just leave some space, 
3:04 we could switch it and we could let's make this 40 or whatever, right,
3:07 we could say look we need some extra room on the outside, 
3:11 and finally, we can go back here and set the border, normally 
3:14 you will set to like 1 or 2 or something small but we'll set it to 10 so it's really obvious. 
3:18 And now we have this border that goes around it, so let's do them all together, 
3:21 so we are going to have a padding of 30, sorry this is a margin, 
3:24 we'll have the margin 30, with the padding of 10, and we'll have the border of just 1. 
3:29 We set those, you can see around each edge we have 30
3:33 and then right around it we have a border that comes next,
3:36 which is the however big it is, in this case it's 1 pixel, 
3:39 and then we have the padding, so you can actually see the thing that we are setting, 
3:43 which is the inside before you get to see its content. 
3:47 So that's the CSS box model, and you can play around with these here 
3:50 and see what you get, now we are going to talk about the developer tools, 
3:54 little bit more, but just while we are on the box model, 
3:56 let me just pull this up and if I say "inspect element", it will show the developer tools for this,
4:00 and you can see I can choose different things like the CSS rules that apply
4:04 and I can toggle them and so on,
4:07 but what I want to point out is that it has this box model here 
4:10 and if we go and find the right piece, not the contained but this thing
4:14 it will show you up here the actual size is 3.23 by 2.22 
4:21 and the reason is the thing inside, the contain or the content is 300 by 200 
4:26 and then we have padding and we have a border, and we have a margin. 
4:30 And you could actually see as I move around that it's highlighting this in the UI. 
4:36 So to understand the CSS box model, you will want to play with these three values 
4:40 along with the display, which we are going to focus on next, 
4:43 and the developer tools, as we get more in depth into them, are really good
4:47 for understanding things like this various sizes 
4:50 and box model settings that are applied here.

 0:02 So, it's time to talk about layout, 
0:05 and layout works in conjunction with the box model
0:08 to basically determine how things look on the screen, where they get placed, 
0:12 when there is new line wraps and so on. 
0:14 If you understand a few things about CSS like the layout, 
0:17 the box model and the selectors, you are like 80% of the way there. 
0:22 So, let's take a pretty cool example here, here we have a list of items, 
0:25 they are actually hyperlinks that go to the various parts of our pages, 
0:29 home, CSS selectors, CSS box model layout and float items, 
0:33 so these should be pretty familiar to you by now, 
0:35 that's just the little list that's on the home screen but notice this is on /layout,
0:39 there is no extra stuff, it's really just this little bit on the screen. 
0:42 So we are going to do just a little bit of CSS and tweak with the layout 
0:46 to turn this into a full-on navigational menu. 
0:50 Now, just to be clear, this navigational menu is probably not 
0:54 what you wanted to do for real navigation, 
0:56 we are going to get to Bootstrap and responsive design 
0:59 and drop down menus and all sorts of cool stuff, 
1:01 but this is more just to show you like look how dramatically we can change 
1:05 the layout and the appearance of a numbered list more or less, 
1:10 so this is going to be really cool and it won't take much effort at all so let's go do this.

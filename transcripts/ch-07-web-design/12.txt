 0:01 Let's look at some of the key concepts behind the CSS box model. 
0:04 As we saw there is basically four things that define the box. 
0:07 First of all, what is the content's width and height, 
0:10 and then how much padding is there, how much of a border is there 
0:15 and then how much of a margin is there. 
0:17 So the colors will help us understand this picture a little bit here. 
0:19 The content is within the black box, background color of whatever it is 
0:24 we are focusing on the box model four, is white 
0:27 and so this padding that sort of is the area outside of the black box. 
0:32 And then the border is blue, and then the margins are always transparent 
0:36 and see through, so they define some space but nothing that you can visually see. 
0:43 We also saw that the developer tools let you quickly and easily understand the box model
0:49 so if you right-click on some element, you hover over it, 
0:51 you can see the computed size with the regard to the box model 
0:55 and the top left here like it says LI 152.31 times 46 
1:00 and if you pull up the computed box model settings 
1:04 you can actually see the exact pieces that make up the box model. 
1:08 So this lets you visually understand the box model but how do you control it? 
1:13 Especially in CSS? Well, we can look at our CSS file and see, 
1:16 so over here we have our site.css and we are going to style something with the lead class,
1:21 and we can set the padding, the margin and the border, 
1:24 you can either do this in a multistep way
1:27 here we are setting the padding all the way around to be 5 on each side 
1:30 and we are overwriting the padding on the left to be 10, 
1:32 so 10 on the left and 5 top, right, and bottom. 
1:36 You can combine that all in one statement, but I always forget which is the top,
1:40 which is the bottom, how many pieces you need 
1:42 so I often want to be really explicit I'll say padding left for example 
1:46 or margin left something like that. 
1:49 Here we are setting the margin and we are using 5 pixels all the way around, 
1:52 you can use any of the CSS measuring units, you can say 5 pixels, 
1:55 you can say 5 em so 5 line heights, things like that, 
1:59 we are also setting the border, so the border here is 1 pixel, it's solid and it's gray 
2:05 which looks very similar to the border on this code block
2:08 that is on the screen right now actually. 
2:11 You can also set things like border radius 
2:13 which will give the whole element sort of a rounded edge style 
2:16 which can be kind of nice sometimes. 
2:18 So this is how you control the box in CSS.

 0:03 Let's review the main ides behind this floating concept, 
0:06 so here is the goal, we want this image to float right, 
0:08 stick to the top, and stay within this little black box that we put it in, 
0:12 and message and other stuff to float left, and then, after that,
0:16 we want to go back to normal layout, put the main content below. 
0:19 All right, so how does this work with "float"? 
0:21 Here is our CSS file, we can just tell it "hey image, float to the right", 
0:25 and like I said before, you are going to probably need to be more specific
0:28 like image #cat if the cat had cat id or something like this, right, 
0:35 you don't want to float all the images, 
0:37 you want to float a specific one but we are going to go to the image 
0:40 and we say "float right", and then we are going to make sure 
0:44 that the image precedes all the stuff that it's suppose to float or wrap around it, 
0:47 in this case it's kind of bizarre, because it wraps to the left, 
0:50 but the stuff that goes around it or is supposed to sort of be next to it, 
0:54 in this floating, idea has to go after the thing, so we put the image first, 
0:59 we tell the float and we put all the content we want there, 
1:02 it's in a real app there is probably more than just "this is the message", 
1:05 and then, when we are done, remember the cat was sticking out of this top div,
1:09 and we need to tell it like: "Hey, stop wrapping around all that stuff, 
1:12 we are done with this idea of wrapping, go back to normal." 
1:15 And the way you do that is you say "clear: both" for the style 
1:19 and you can put it on anything, it could be hyperlink, it could be whatever, 
1:21 but here is more or less invisible element, which is a zero height div 
1:27 and that's just as good as any. 
1:29 So when we want to stop wrapping, we say "clear: both", 
1:32 "left" or "right" are the other options.

0:03 There is a variety of ways we can style HTML pages with CSS.
0:07 But by far the most flexible and most modular and professional way to do this
0:12 is to use one or more style sheets.
0:15 So, let's look really quickly at what goes in the style sheet, some of the major pieces,
0:19 and we'll use these ideas throughout the rest of this chapter,
0:22 and really, honestly through the rest of this course.
0:25 Here we have this file and this static folder called site.css
0:29 and any page we wanted to use it, obviously we have to include that style sheet
0:33 being present in the site obviously isn't enough,
0:35 you have to include it in each and every HTML page you wanted to style,
0:39 and we'll see when we get to the more advanced
0:42 the second part of the web development, a way to unify this across our entire site
0:47 so we put in one and only one place and it flows across the site,
0:50 but however we accomplish that, we need this link "a href",
0:55 link to our style sheet with the "rel" style sheet settings.
0:58 Now notice, we don't have to close it off here, unless we are doing XHTML,
1:02 all the HTML5 content browsers these days totally understand it like this.
1:06 The first thing that we can do is we can target elements that are just native to HTML,
1:11 so here we are going to target the body and we could target things like
1:14 paragraphs, divs, "a" for anchors and things like that.
1:18 And so you can specify by a name, there is not that many HTML elements
1:21 so there is a limited set of what you can put here, of course.
1:25 But, you can have these bare names for HTML elements
1:28 and then you can style them and this is very common,
1:31 you might want to style tables look or h1, h2 headers look and things like that.
1:37 Here you can see we are setting the background color
1:39 to #ccc which is just a little bit off white, and we are setting the color,
1:44 the text color to #222, so something just a step back from full black.
1:50 And the format here is totally standard,
1:52 you have the selector and the selectors can be complex as we'll see in just a second,
1:55 so body but this could be very complicated,
1:58 then we have curly brace a bunch of CSS properties we are going to set
2:02 and then there is a close curly. Of course, semicolon each line.
2:05 So, let's look at something a little more flexible,
2:08 if we want to style my CSS class, instead of just saying the name
2:12 we say .name, so in CSS . (dot) means class.
2:16 And, we can map that over to HTML that looks like this,
2:19 there's class= whatever you put after the dot.
2:22 And here we are just doing more properties,
2:24 we are working with the box style for a little bit
2:26 so we are setting the padding, we are setting the line height here is a little tip,
2:30 if you want a readable set of content, one thing that you can do
2:33 that is really easy, that makes a big difference just as a reader of the site,
2:39 is if you set the line height a little bit higher than default, which is just one,
2:43 because that little extra space makes it a little extra readable
2:47 and surprising how much just a little bit of line height=1.25 em or 1.5 em, something like that,
2:53 "em" is the standard height so this is like a scaling factor,
2:55 like 1.25 times basically, it's a way to think of that.
2:59 Now, we can have like I said, more complicated selectors here,
3:02 so we are expressing the hierarchy in this next one,
3:05 we are saying "I'd like to go to anything in the page that has the class nav",
3:09 .nav means class nav and then "space another item" means contained within that thing
3:15 I found with the class nav, somewhere deep down in the tree
3:19 could be immediately contained or it could be several steps down,
3:22 contained within this nav item, is an unordered list ul
3:25 and that unordered list has a dropdown class.
3:29 There might be many unordered lists in the nav,
3:31 the one that has the class dropdown, so the lack of space between these,
3:36 so ul.dropdown expresses that the class is on the ul.
3:41 And then, we want to say "immediately within that ul we have a thing with profile image",
3:47 so the "greater than" sign means it's not just somewhere in the hierarchy,
3:51 it's directly contained within this thing, so ul and then right within it,
3:56 there is something with id profile. So, the hash there maps to id.
4:04 So we have bare elements, we have .things for classes
4:08 and we have #things for ids, so here you can see #name maps to id=name in HTML.
4:14 Now, this is style sheet, so this is kind of the ss, if you will of CSS,
4:21 the other part is the cascading and inheritance styles, so if we look over here,
4:25 we can say .content.lead and this is a specialization of the content setting.
4:31 On the second item we are staying everything with content has padding of 20,
4:36 but if it happens to be the content and a lead,
4:40 so maybe the first paragraph that is content is marked as lead,
4:44 something like that, it gets a little more padding,
4:47 so when you combine without spaces, you are doing an "and" operation,
4:50 so here we are saying "the element we are looking for
4:54 has both the class content and the class lead."
4:57 Notice how this inherits from the content above,
5:00 so the padding is replaced by the specialization.
5:04 So the lead one has padding 30 not 20, it's setting the font size to 18
5:09 so it's making the fonts more specific,
5:12 but the line height, because the more specialized one doesn't apply,
5:17 it falls back to just the content, so the line height of the content with lead is also 1.25 em.
5:23 So that is a light introduction to CSS,
5:26 this will give you a little bit of a handhold on where we are getting started
5:30 and we are going to look at selectors in much greater detail in an upcoming video.

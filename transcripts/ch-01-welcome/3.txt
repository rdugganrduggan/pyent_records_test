0:02 We can group these general topics we are going to cover into five big areas.
0:07 First one is building your online product.
0:10 This is web development and web design.
0:13 So we are going to talk about how to actually build your web app
0:15 and how to make it look good.
0:17 We are also going to talk about managing your development process,
0:20 with your editors, source control, that kind of stuff.
0:24 Then we are going to take your online product
0:27 and show you how to turn it into a functioning business.
0:29 How do we integrate credit cards, how do we integrate email,
0:33 all the various things that you need to actually have a working online business.
0:37 Then we are going to talk about putting that business online,
0:40 how do we deploy it, how do we setup our servers, and virtual machines,
0:43 how do we monitor for errors in performance and production.
0:46 And finally we are going to talk about growth.
0:48 Remember the opening section, that dusty set of motocross riders?
0:52 we are going to talk about how you can break free of that pack and get ahead.
0:56 So if we look at the technologies that we are going to use to build our web app,
0:59 it's going to start with our web framework, Pyramid.
1:02 There are many web frameworks we can choose in Python,
1:04 the three most popular probably are Django, Flask and Pyramid,
1:08 and Pyramid is a really nice balance between too much hand holding
1:12 and too small, it's the goldielocks framework, in my opinion.
1:16 We are also going to talk about Python some of the core language concepts
1:19 that you need for your web app to work
1:22 and we are going to use SQLAlchemy to talk to our database
1:25 and create a data-driven web application.
1:27 So, this is the code side; on the other hand, we also need it to look decent.
1:32 Now, we don't assume that you are a designer,
1:34 but we are going to show you enough CSS and HTML
1:37 that you can build something that is functional and - not terrible - let's say,
1:41 and if you're great at design you could probably do way better than that,
1:44 but we'll get you started so that you are at least comfortable with HTML and CSS
1:47 and some of the front-end frameworks,
1:49 we are going to use Bootstrap but there are a couple of options there.
1:52 So, these are the technologies involved in building your web application.
1:55 And while you are building it,
1:57  we are going to talk about what you need for the development process.
2:00 We are going to be using PyCharm as our IDE,
2:03 our enhanced editor that will let us do all kinds of things,
2:06 we can create a Pyramid web app with it,
2:08 we can of course edit the Python code access and manage our database,
2:12 work with JavaScript and CSS and HTML,
2:15 it's a great all-around editor for what we are trying to do.
2:18 We are going to use Git and GitHub to manage our code,
2:21 make sure that it's safe and sound,
2:23 we can always get back to a previous working version and most importantly,
2:26 it will let us aggressively experiment
2:28 and try new ideas without fear of breaking it irreparably.
2:33 Once we have our application built,
2:35 we are going to have to make it a real business,
2:37 so we'll have to deal with users, users' accounts,
2:40 all the various things around resetting their passwords and sending them receipts,
2:44 that kind of stuff, so we'll have to have inbound and outbound email,
2:48 and most importantly, to us, probably is accepting money from them,
2:53 so we are going to integrate Stripe and credit card processing into our application.
2:57 Once our app is ready to go live, we need to put it on web server somewhere.
3:01 So we are going to deploy it onto Ubuntu, using Digital Ocean,
3:05 so we want to create some virtual machines on Digital Ocean
3:08  that are Ubuntu servers and we'll push them out.
3:10 Of course, for accepting credit cards
3:12 and working with user accounts and passwords,
3:15 we are going to want to use SSL so we'll see how to integrate SSL into our web server,
3:19 we'll use Engine X as the front line web server
3:22 and then we are going to use uWSGI,
3:25 to run our application behind the scenes.
3:27 Once we get it all up and running, we want to make sure that it's working right,
3:30 so we are going to integrate Rollbar error monitoring
3:33 into the system, that will send us messages on Slack or email or whatever we want
3:37 if something happens to go wrong,
3:39 and we may know if there is a problem before even our users do.
3:43 Finally, we are going to talk about growth, because,
3:45 having the technical pieces in place, as we said, is not enough.
3:49 These days, running a business is as much about marketing and positioning
3:54 as it is about the technology, technology is of course required and table stakes,
3:58 but to really break free you have to work on getting the word out,
4:02 standing out on Google, reaching the users where they are.
4:05 So, we are going to talk about SEO in Google,
4:08 we'll talk about mailing lists, acquiring interested users,
4:11 converting them to paying users,
4:12 and a whole bunch of other things that fall into this banner called growth hacking,
4:17 a bunch of techniques that are non-obvious
4:20 and maybe users never see but actually attract attention,
4:22 attract users, and grow your business.

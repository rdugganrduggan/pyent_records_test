0:01 So you are ready to build your own business,
0:02 we are going to build one together, and what are we going to build?
0:05 Well, we are going to build a rock and roll band's e-commerce site.
0:09 And this is our favorite fictional tech-based
0:12 rock and roll band called The Blue/Yellow Rockets.
0:14 And, you can see right on the screen we've got a nice design,
0:17 with the CSS front-end framework, this is Bootstrap, it's responsive,
0:20 we also have mailing lists for users
0:23 who are interested in hearing more about our events that are not yet published,
0:27 under the albums, if you went in there you would see that you could do
0:30 e-commerce, sign in and register lets us create accounts,
0:33 most of the things that you can do in our app,
0:36 you can see right on this front page here,
0:38 so we are going to build this app slowly;
0:40 first we are going to start out just building a basic website that is static.
0:45 And then, we are going to add a little dynamicness to it,
0:47 using SQLAlchemy and databases,
0:50 then we are going to add credit cards and mailing lists
0:52 and all the stuff you need to do to build a business rather than just an app,
0:56 and then we are going to deploy that
0:58 and use a little SEO to try to get it to show up in Google.
1:00 So that's what we are going to build, and of course,
1:02 you want to have the source code, so how do you get it? Well, GitHub of course,
1:07 here at this URL, you will be able to go and download
1:09 everything you see us create throughout this class,
1:12 so I recommend you go right now to
1:14 github.com/mikeckennedy/python-for-entrepreneurs-course-demos.
1:19 Maybe that's a little bit long, but go there and either star this or fork it or both.

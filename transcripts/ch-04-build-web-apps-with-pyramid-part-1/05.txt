0:02 It's time to get started. Let's create our Pyramid web app.
0:05 So, the steps to do that look like this-
0:07 we are going to start out and create a virtual environment,
0:09 technically this step is optional
0:12 but virtual environments help us understand
0:14 what packages are in play for a particular application,
0:17 which means where you have a better understanding
0:19 of what we need to push out to production when we actually deploy our application.
0:23 I find this helpful, it's up to you, you can skip this step if you want.
0:26 Then we are going to install the Pyramid package and all of its dependencies,
0:31 which will happen automatically.
0:34 Pyramid comes with scaffolding, and what that means is
0:36 there is a lot of moving parts to the website, you've got your CSS,
0:40 your JavaScript, your static folders, your views, it has unit tests,
0:45 it itself is a Python package, so it has some files associated with that
0:49 and while you can of course create all these yourself,
0:52 it's completely non-productive
0:54 and so there are four different kinds of starter applications we can create
0:57 using this scaffolding,
0:59 so after we've installed Pyramid, we are going to give our application a jumpstart
1:02 by choosing one of the scaffolding starter sites to begin with.
1:06 Pyramid is a little unique in that the website
1:09 that gets created is itself a Python package,
1:12 and so that means there is a simple step we have to run
1:15 to register that package with the Python runtime
1:18 or environment that we are working in,
1:20 so if we are creating in a virtual environment, register it there
1:22 before doing it in a global one on our machine, register it there,
1:25 so it knows how to find its views and its startup code and all that kind of stuff.
1:30 We'd run our app, we serve it up, we add our features and of course,
1:33 we go back around and we just iteratively develop it
1:36 until we have our app ready for deployment.
1:39 Now, how do you want to get started?
1:41 We could use the IDE PyCharm, click a few buttons and create our web application,
1:46 or we could go the command line route
1:48 and run a couple of commands in the terminal, and create our application.
1:52 We are actually going to go through both ways, PyCharm is simpler,
1:56 but I think you don't get to see all the moving parts,
1:59 so maybe there might be a step or two that you don't totally understand,
2:02 so let's go through the command line version first,
2:06 see all the steps involved and then if you have PyCharm Professional,
2:09 you can click a few buttons and create a website straight away,
2:12 if you have PyCharm Community Edition or another one,
2:15 you want to follow along with the CLI version.

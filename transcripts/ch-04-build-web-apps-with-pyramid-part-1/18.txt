0:01 In order to use Bower, you have to install it.
0:03 And the way you get it installed is with npm, so you just "npm install -g" for global,
0:09 rather than local one, "bower".
0:12 So here you can see it says it requires node, npm and git.
0:18 I've already installed bower, so I don't need to do that
0:21 but you should follow these directions using node and npm,
0:24 once you get them set up, we are going to work with installing our dependencies.
0:28 so over here, we have our web application, and you can see our code,
0:34 this is our top level for a website, here is the egg-info from "setup.py develop"
0:40 and here is the actual logic of our application,
0:44 and the static folder is where we would like to put things
0:47 like JavaScript, CSS, images and so on,
0:50 so that seems like the right place for Bower to manage its dependencies
0:53 which largely consists of those things.
0:56 So let's go over here, we can see that I am actually in that folder, in the static folder
1:01 and let's say "bower list", see if anything is here, nope, there is nothing here,
1:06 and notice, there is no bower components folder here,
1:10 so you know there is actually nothing going on with bower.
1:12 One of the things we want to replace, we saw the dependency on Bootstrap,
1:16 and we would like to replace that so why don't we install that?
1:19 Your first inclination would be to do this:
1:23 And it's fine, you can totally "bower install bootstrap",
1:26 but you are going to get all of the assets
1:28 and things, basically clone the entire bootstrap repo in GitHub,
1:33 so you have all the building blocks,
1:35 not just the stuff you want to ship for your after work,
1:38 so there is a shorter version you can use, so if you say "-css",
1:42 it just brings kind of non-intuitive, it brings a CSS, JavaScript and fonts
1:47 but basically the distribution folder for bootstrap.
1:51 So I've already installed this, it doesn't need to download it,
1:53 you can see it's taking this straight from GitHub, it's validated it and it's installed it.
1:58 Now if we go back here, you can see we have bower_components, bootstrap-css,
2:02 little bower project file we've got the CSS that we need, minified, non-minified,
2:06 we've got the fonts and we've got the JavaScript, again minified and non-minified.
2:12 What's so different about this?
2:13 Well, one we have it offline, we could have just gone
2:15 and downloaded bootstrap and dropped it in here, unzipped it,
2:18 but then we couldn't upgrade it, we couldn't manage it,
2:21 so for example I can come over here and say "bower update",
2:25 and if there was a new version of bootstrap,
2:28 it would have actually upgraded it for us, so that's really cool.
2:31 You know, do that for all of our dependencies,
2:34 We probably want jQuery, so let's go and install that,
2:38 move this over so you can see them coming in,
2:40 so we have bower, we have jQuery, we saw Respond.js we also saw HTML5 Shiv
2:48 let's put those in, so now we have those as well.
2:52 Another one that I think is great is Font Awesome.
2:55 Font Awesome is really good for little widgets and icons in your site,
3:00 that are not actually images but are fonts
3:02 so you can color them and resize them perfectly,
3:05 so let's put that in there as well. Beautiful.
3:09 Now, all of our components are set up here,
3:11 so Font Awesome for example, there are our fonts.
3:15 And the last thing to do is go to our template and start using these
3:18 instead of the ones that are coming off the CDN.
3:22 Notice over here how this refreshed, let's go and find our bootstrap.css here
3:28 copy the path, and let's update this.
3:34 Now you don't want the whole path of course,
3:37 you just want from static down, because this is sort of the folder
3:40 containing our app, this down is our app,
3:44 so let's just go back here and cut this off, like so,
3:46 so now we have our Bootstrap.
3:48 Now, there is one little detail about this possibly getting cached and if we update it,
3:54 that could be a problem, it rarely is for Bootstrap, it much more likely is for our site.
3:58 Let's do the same for HTML5 Shiv and Respond.js.
4:05 Great, so that should take care of things for the CSS
4:08 and now we just have to do the JavaScript.
4:12 I have no intention of debugging these, so let's just keep using the min versions.
4:16 All right, let's run the site, it better still look the same.
4:20 Oh, how interesting, this is worth pointing out,
4:22 so when you create one of these projects in PyCharm,
4:25 notice there is two blue_yellow_apps running here,
4:28 this one has little green dot that means it's still running,
4:31 this is one I tried to run, it crashed so it exited sadly with code 1, that makes it sad,
4:36 so what happened? Well, these web apps of course they listen on a port
4:40 but you can only have one app or process bound to that port,
4:44 well, how do we solve that? We just go to PyCharm and say "PyCharm don't do that",
4:48 say I would like a single instance only
4:51 so that way when you say "I want to run or rerun this app",
4:54 it will shut down the old one, meaning there should be no problem running it.
4:58 Here notice I wasn't using my virtual environment, so let's set that back as well.
5:03 Notice how it asks: "Do you want to rerun this?"
5:06 Just say "never ever show me that again",
5:09 and it will automatically rerun it for us every time.
5:12 Wonderful, so it's up and running on localhost, let's have a look,
5:15 see everything is still working.
5:18 Well that sure looks like Bootstrap, let's have a quick look;
5:23 so here you can see our Bootstrap, if I click on this, great, we have Twitter Bootstrap.
5:28 And what else were we looking for? Response.js but of course,
5:31 these are only brought in for IE8, I really hope no one is using IE8,
5:36 all right, let's check this out one more time, jQuery, OK, good, jQuery is good,
5:39 and the bootstrap.js, perfect,
5:42 so it looks like we've successfully moved to Bower,
5:47 managing our various dependencies, bootstrap distribution,
5:51 Font Awesome, HTML5 Shiv and Respond for old school IE support, and jQuery.
5:57 Finally, if you ever wonder "well, what is installed here
6:00 what versions and so on", you can easily ask Bower.
6:04 Say "list" and it will tell you if there is an upgrade or anything like that,
6:07 for our purposes we can ignore extraneous, this thing sort of manages this
6:12 as if we are building a Bower package ourselves
6:15 and then these are the dependencies and then what it's saying is
6:17 "you are not using this in your current package", no no, we are not using that way,
6:20 we are just simply installing them into our web app.
6:23 If we wanted to set up a file with these dependencies
6:25 so we could regenerate them just from our bower.json, we could,
6:29 but I don't really see a huge benefit to that.

0:02 Let's have a quick look at the relative performance of Python
0:06 among all the technologies that you might use to build web applications.
0:11 But before I show you this graph,
0:12 I want to emphasize that performance is not the only thing
0:15 when you are starting a business,
0:17 it's much more important that it's easy to work with
0:19 that it's quick to get something out the door,
0:21 but it's also nice to know if what you are working with is going to live a while
0:26 as your business grows that you won't have to replace it right away,
0:28 that it would be able to handle some decent growth
0:31 before you maybe have to so some sort of optimization or even change frameworks.
0:36 So let's look at Python relative to the other technologies.
0:39 Here is a graph of numbers taken from the TechEmpower benchmark,
0:43 and this is one of the more well respected benchmarks for web applications
0:48 and it's absolutely comprehensive,
0:50 there are many frameworks and variations on different servers
0:53 with different databases and so on.
0:56 So here you can see we have a couple of technologies,
0:58 the fastest one that I put on the list it's not the fastest,
1:02 but it's definitely interesting, is Bottle.
1:05 So Bottle running on Python 2 is quite quick,
1:08 it's doing over 35 thousand requests per minute.
1:11 Than we have Flask, running on Python 2, remember,
1:13 these are all micro frameworks, they do less so you would expect them
1:17 to be able to be able to do more of it.
1:19 Then we have Pyramid with Python 3 right there
1:21 and it's coming in third, that's pretty excellent.
1:23 Let's look at the rest, just down from that we've got Node.js and MySQL
1:27 and we have Flask and Bottle in Python 3, we have Django,
1:30 we have Ruby on Rails and we have ASP.NET running on Mono.
1:34 So I think you can see that our choice of Pyramid puts us well
1:38 to the right of this graph, it's certainly not bad, in terms of performance,
1:41 but notice something else, that if we look at this on Python 3 alone, remember,
1:47 Python 2 is getting phased out in just a couple of years,
1:50 and there will only be Python 3 going forward,
1:53 if we look at Pyramid 3 on Python 3 and we take away say Bottle and Python 2,
1:58 we only look at it running on Python 3 for example, well then,
2:01 our choice looks pretty smart on performance.
2:03 So as you can see, Pyramid is a very capable web framework in terms of performance
2:08 it's been great for all of my businesses,
2:11 I've been able to run my businesses and websites on Pyramid
2:14 on simple cheap virtual machines as you'll see
2:18 we'll do something similar with Digital Ocean, here in this course.
2:21 My podcast receives over a million HTTP requests to the Python backend
2:25 which goes all the way to the database, per month,
2:28 and running that on a 10 dollar Digital Ocean server
2:32 doesn't even break a sweat. Barely registers on the CPU meter.

0:01 When deciding on a Python web framework,
0:03 it's important to consider the tradeoffs that you make
0:05 when you choose a particular framework.
0:07 So on one hand, we have a host or what are called micro frameworks,
0:11 these frameworks are very lightweight
0:13 and they are great for building quick, simple applications,
0:16 and then you bring many many pieces together to add on functionality.
0:20 Will that allow you to make exactly the app that you want
0:23 because you've only brought in the pieces that you need,
0:26 it's actually a lot of work and it's a little bit hard for beginners
0:29 because you don't know about all the little pieces you've got to put together.
0:32 On the other hand, we have what I am calling building block frameworks,
0:35 maybe this is not quite the right term but what I mean is
0:38 these are the frameworks that have large pieces that you can stack together
0:42 maybe you want to admin backend for your database, boom
0:45 here is a little piece you stick in there
0:47 you want to data access layer right into the framework,
0:50 boom, there is your ORM, the way that you talk to your database, and so on.
0:53 These are great, if that's what you want to use,
0:56 but if you don't want to use those,
0:58 if you want to use a different kind of database, say a NoSQL database versus a relational one,
1:02 then all of the sudden these building blocks can be getting in your way
1:05 and you have to work your way around them.
1:07 That's kind of the way I see the spectrum of the web frameworks,
1:10 and in the building block area, we have Django.
1:13 one of the most popular web frameworks for Python
1:16 and it has a lot of great building blocks, but like I said, has things like a built in ORM,
1:21 and if you don't want to access data in the way their ORM works,
1:23 or you are kind of fighting against the system a little bit, to go and do something different.
1:27 On the other end we have frameworks like Bottle,
1:30 which are fast but very simple and don't come with very much functionality,
1:34 I would put Flask just up above Bottle in terms of what it brings to the table
1:39 and how many little pieces you have to put together.
1:41 And then in the middle, what I would call the goldielocks range,
1:43 not to small, not too big, would be Pyramid.
1:47 Pyramid is a framework that we are going to be using for this course,
1:50 it's not as much of a building block thing as Django,
1:54 you can pick all the various pieces
1:56 you want to use Mongo DB, no problem, use Mongo DB,
1:58 it's a little more full featured than some of the micro frameworks.
2:01 So, let's take a look at Pyramid now.

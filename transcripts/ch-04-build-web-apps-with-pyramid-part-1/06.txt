0:01 Here I am in my terminal and we are going to create a virtual environment,
0:04 install Pyramid and create our first starter application.
0:08 So the first thing we want to do is create a virtual environment
0:11 and we are going to do that in our Python environments folder.
0:13 That's where I put mine, you can put yours wherever you want.
0:16 So the way we do that is we say "python3 -m" for run a module, "venv"
0:22 and then, you just put the directory where you want it created,
0:24 so we are going to say /python_environments
0:28 and we'll call this "blueyellow"
0:31 for the name of our application that we are going to create.
0:33 Just hit Enter, Python will make some symbolic links
0:36 and copy some files over to create a dedicated,
0:39 isolated version of Python 3 right there.
0:43 All right, it's done, so let's go check it out,
0:47 in here you can see we have a couple of folders,
0:49 and let's go into the bin folder and you see "activate",
0:53 this application will change our current configuration around
0:57 so that this particular version of Python
0:59 is what's active in the PATH and things like that.
1:02 We need to apply its output and its behavior to this shell,
1:05 not to one that gets created, associated with independent process,
1:09 so I could either say "source activate", or the shortcut is .(dot), so .activate
1:16 notice my prompt has changed, to blue yellow
1:19 and if I asked the question "which python", it says this one here.
1:23 And if we go up to code folder and look here,
1:26 and we ask the same question "which python",
1:28 still, because the environment's been reconfigured, this is the one.
1:31 So step one complete, our virtual environment is created and activated.
1:36 The next thing to do is see what's installed in our environment.
1:38 As you can imagine, not much,
1:40 basically just the tooling required to install more things,
1:44 so we want to install Pyramid and we'll use pip to do so,
1:49 so "pip install pyramid", let it download, wait a moment, success,
1:54 so you can see we installed PasteDeploy, WebOb, Pyramid,
1:57 repoze and a couple of other things that Pyramid depends on.
2:00 The other thing we have now as part of that is the scaffolding
2:05 you can see in the bin folder we now have something called pcreate,
2:09 let's see what that is.
2:10 If we say "pcreate -l", that will list the available scaffolds,
2:15 so we have one based on SQLAlchemy, SQLlite and URL dispatch,
2:18 we have the starter one based on URL dispatch and Chameleon,
2:22 and we have the ZODB version.
2:24 We are going to use the starter code, so the way it works is
2:27 you just say pcreate, you choose the template and then you name the folder.
2:35 We'll say "pcreate -s" for scaffold starter,
2:39 and then we are going to call our application blue_yellow_app.
2:42 So a bunch of stuff happens and it looks like it failed,
2:45 because the word sorry appears, but no no,
2:47 "welcome to Pyramid, sorry for the convenience."
2:50 Lovely. If we look around, our blue_yellow_app now exists,
2:53 and if we look in here, you can see that we have a couple of files as well,
2:59 we have a couple of files that are associated with the package,
3:03 and we now have our web files as well, our views, our tests,
3:08 our static templates and so on.
3:10 The next thing that you would like to do is you would like to run the sample web app,
3:15 I am sure you are going to run into this problem
3:17 either your first time setting up
3:19 or when you go to deploy it somewhere or something like that.
3:22 So let me just try to run this, so we can say pserve
3:26 and give either the development.ini or prod.ini,
3:31 either development or production configuration file.
3:33 When I run this, it's going to give me an error.
3:36 Waitress is not found, if I install waitress it will give another error,
3:40 eventually it will say something like "blue_yellow_app not found."
3:44 In order to tell Python about our blue_yellow_app, we just need to run the setup.py file.
3:52 Now, we also need to give it the command, what do we want to do with setup,
3:55 the two common options here would be either "install",
3:58 which would install the package, copy all the files somewhere and install it,
4:02 that's not what we want, the other option we can put is "develop".
4:05 And "develop" will say "Python, look where we have our current files now,
4:09 where we just created them, look there for this package",
4:12 so as we make edits and so on, these will automatically be picked up.
4:15 So, "python setup.py develop", that's what we want.
4:19 You can see that Python is installing all the dependencies
4:22 that are particular applications as pulled in through this scaffolding.
4:25 great, you can see "Finished processing dependencies for blue_yellow_app",
4:29 now we are ready to serve it up,
4:31 beautiful, we are running on localhost, let's see what's there.
4:38 Perfect, Pyramid is up and running,
4:41 here is our starter scaffold and it says
4:44 "Welcome to blue_yellow_app, running on Pyramid web framework 1.7.3."
4:49 It's just a start, but everything is up and running
4:51 ready for us to start adding the features that make our app our app.

0:02 Let's talk about the building blocks
0:04 that you are going to use to build your application when you are using Pyramid.
0:08 The first thing that we want to do is take a request from the outside world
0:12 and somehow map this into our application and that all begins with routes,
0:16 routes are URL patterns that we then map into particular view methods,
0:21 speaking of views, these are the methods
0:23 that are going to process our request,
0:25 whether they show us an HTML page through rendering a template
0:29 or make some kind of update to a database and do a redirect,
0:32 that's where we are going to do it, is it in these view methods.
0:35 And note that in MVC, these are called controllers.
0:39 Next, we are going to talk about templates,
0:41 typically what we'll do with our views is we'll come up with some sort of data
0:45 and then we'll pass that off to a dynamic template
0:48 and this template is going to take that data
0:50 and turn it into HTML that actually goes back to the user.
0:54 The thing that flows between the views and the templates are called models,
0:59 and these are basically dictionaries in Python
1:01 and this is both data and behavior that we can pass to the view.
1:06 Pyramid has rich support for static assets,
1:09 so images, cascading style sheets, JavaScript
1:13 and more, we'll be able to manage those separately,
1:16 more or less offloading the request out of our web app
1:19 and passing it just to the web server itself.
1:22 We also want to work with configuration files,
1:24 you want to put your API keys and other sorts of information like that
1:28 into the configuration files and these are often different between dev, tests and prod.

0:02 Let's review creating a Pyramid web app in PyCharm.
0:06 And, my motto is you get more at once with PyCharm,
0:09 you type in only what you want
0:11 and it basically configures the whole system for you right away.
0:15 On this screen here we are going to install Pyramid,
0:17 we are going to create a virtual environment,
0:19 we are going to choose the scaffolding and the template language, all at once.
0:23 Then we wait a moment for PyCharm to do its magic,
0:25 basically it runs to the steps you saw on the command line version as well,
0:29 and then, when it's time to register our package and install the dependencies,
0:33 you'll see a warning right across the top straight away
0:36 but doing this step is all that is required and will fulfil those dependencies,
0:39 so you go to tools, run setup.py task
0:42 and that gives you a bunch of options, we are going to choose develop,
0:45 which will register this application as a package in place,
0:48 which means as we make changes to it and restart it,
0:51 it will automatically pick up those changes,
0:53 no need to reinstall it or weird stuff like that.
0:56 And then you press this little green button
0:57 PyCharm has created a run configuration
1:00 pointed at the development.ini configuration
1:03 and listening on this port, so you just press that button, the play button to run it,
1:07 or the debug, the bug button to debug it, depending on what you are trying to do.
1:12 You'll see down here at the bottom, it will say it's serving on some port
1:15 which is a hyperlink, just click that and you are winning with PyCharm.
1:19 You have your web app up and running,
1:21 in your default browser, ready to check it out and see what you've built.
1:25 Of course, now the real work begins of building your web application.

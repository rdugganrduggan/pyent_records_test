0:01 We've seen how to create a Pyramid web app
0:03 using the command line interface with the CLI.
0:05 Now let's choose PyCharm and see how it makes things much easier.
0:13 We'll begin by creating a new project.
0:16 It automatically selects a pure Python one, but that's not what we want,
0:19 we want a Pyramid web application.
0:22 Remember, our first step is to create and use a virtual environment.
0:25 So let's do that here. So we'll say create a virtual environment,
0:30 let's call this something like blueyellowpy, for PyCharm.
0:34 We are going to base this on Python 3.5, it says 3.5.1. but really it's 3.5.2.
0:43 Note that it's automatically going to install Pyramid into the selected interpreter.
0:47 Now let's expand the "More Settings".
0:49 Remember "pcreate list" for the scaffolding - here is this three options,
0:53 we just click this, we'll just leave "None" for our template language,
0:56 that will use Chameleon and let's give this app a name
0:59 let's call it something like we had this before in code,
1:03 let's call it something like blueyellowpy, something like that,
1:08 just to know that this is the app that we created.
1:11 So what have we done? We've selected Pyramid,
1:14 we created a virtual environment based on Python 3.5.1, really 3.5.2.
1:20 it's just a path I didn't get updated when I upgraded my system,
1:23 and we chose the starter scaffold from Pyramid,
1:26 so it's going to install Pyramid, it's going to run this, everything we need to do,
1:30 in all those options before happens here.
1:37 Now notice right away, if we expand this out,
1:39 we have exactly the same files as we had before,
1:42 PyCharm is looking in the setup file and it knows that it stated these requirements here
1:46 these three requirements, and they are not installed.
1:48 We could go and click install them here but remember,
1:51 we also have to register our app.
1:53 Let's go and just click "install" just to see what happens.
1:57 Watch the little progress bar in the bottom right,
2:00 OK, everything is almost ready to go, but just like before,
2:03 if I try to run this, you'll see that this app does not exist,
2:08 right, this package does not exist
2:10 and we talked about this being a proper package and registering it in place
2:15 using the development to command,
2:17 so we could go to the terminal, and run Python 3
2:20 or activate this virtual environment first then run Python, "setup.py develop".
2:25 But in PyCharm, we can just come here and say "run setup task" and we type "develop",
2:29 you can see all the task here we have install, we have develop,
2:33 and it even tells you what it's going to do.
2:35 So we hit that, and it registers this just as we did on the command line
2:40 and just like that, we are ready to go. Click on this,
2:45 ta-da, just like before we have our Python web application up and running,
2:49 and we have our blue yellow PyCharm app created from the starter scaffolding.
2:55 So you can see PyCharm takes a lot of the steps
2:58 and guess work out of creating a Pyramid web app, but remember,
3:01 this only works in the Professional Edition,
3:05 so you need a Professional Edition of PyCharm
3:07 Free Community Edition does not come with the web application support,
3:10 so you don't have these options
3:12 got to go through the command line interface if that's what you have.

0:02 Let's take just a moment and talk about Pyramid - the web framework
0:05 and the principles behind it, before we look at the code
0:08 and the building blocks to create web apps with Pyramid.
0:11 You can learn more about Pyramid at trypyramid.com
0:14 and they have this little saying up here that I think captures a lot about the framework
0:17 "The start small, finish big, stay finished framework"
0:21 Idea is you don't have to know a lot to use Pyramid,
0:24 there is a few simple building blocks and then many more
0:28 that you can bring in as your app grows in complexity and needs,
0:31 and they have a 100% unit tests and they are very conservative
0:35 about pushing on new versions, so it's the "stay finished framework" as well.
0:41 Pyramid focuses on simplicity
0:43 and they take a "pay only for what you eat" approach
0:46 and it has a really interesting idea behind it
0:49 that you should be able to get started with Pyramid
0:51 even if you only have a partial understanding of it,
0:54 that means you can do the major things, how do I render some HTML to a view,
0:58 how do I process a post, things like that, without fully digging into all the details
1:03 which I think is a really constructive way to get started.
1:06 Remember, I called Pyramid the Goldielocks framework
1:09 because it's not a micro framework that has too little,
1:12 it's also not a large building block framework
1:15 that you have to take the large building blocks and put them together or not,
1:19 they focus on the core things that you do in a web framework,
1:22 mapping URLs and code, templates and serving assets.
1:26 Pyramid has great documentation and tutorials to help you dig deeper,
1:31 we saw earlier that Pyramid is very fast
1:34 and especially when you consider the Python 3 angle,
1:38 in the age of cloud computing it's easy to think we can throw
1:41 as many machines at a problem as we need, that costs money
1:44 but more importantly that costs complexity,
1:47 so having a pretty fast framework is a real benefit.
1:52 Pyramid has 100% test coverage and their philosophy is if it ain't tested it's broken.
1:57 So you can count on new releases of Pyramid not breaking your code.
2:03 As you can see, Pyramid is open source, it's available on GitHub
2:07 and is distributed under a permissive open source license.
2:11 Finally, Pyramid is one of the few frameworks
2:14 that takes a forward-looking approach to Python 3.
2:17 Python 3 is the default implementation
2:20 their documentation and tutorials are in Python 3
2:23 and that's the recommended way to run Pyramid.
2:26 So as we transition from Python 2 to Python 3 as an industry,
2:30 Pyramid is already in the right place to make that transition
2:33 because they have already gone through it.

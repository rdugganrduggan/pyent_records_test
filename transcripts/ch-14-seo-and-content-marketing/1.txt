00:01 You worked really hard on building your business. 
00:03 But prospective customers are not just going to show up for no reason, 
00:06 you will have to take a thoughtful intentional approach towards marketing 
00:09 particularly with the content that you create and making sure 
00:12 that that content appears as high as possible 
00:15 in Google through search engine optimization. 
00:17 So that is what this chapter is about, 
00:19 search engine optimization and a bit of an introduction to content marketing, 
00:23 which will set the foundation for our growth hacking chapter later on.
00:26 Search engine optimization or SEO seems like it's a complicated topic, 
00:31 a dark art, but really, what it comes down to is just making your business 
00:35 more likely to be found by prospective customers, 
00:40 if you are the top result in Google or on the first page of Google search results, 
00:44 for keyword terms that describe problems that your business solves, 
00:48 then more people are going to know about your business, 
00:51 and are going to try your product to see if it solves their problems. 
00:54 SEO comes down to following a few basic principles
00:57 that actually make your content better, 
01:00 and make it more accessible to people who read websites. 
01:03 Don't think about this as tricking Google or tricking Bing 
01:06 into making what you write pop up higher in the rankings, 
01:09 there is nothing tricky about it, we'll take this nebulous topic known as SEO 
01:13 and we'll have some basic steps that you can follow 
01:16 and what it's going to give you is when you put in 10 percent of the effort, 
01:19 you're going to get 90 percent of the results. 
01:22 You can read entire books on SEO but what we're covering in this chapter 
01:25 is absolutely the most important parts and there are very simple principles. 
01:29 Ultimately, this will make what you create better and because it's better, 
01:33 it's more likely to pop up at the top of search results.
01:37 And what should you create in order to market your business? 
01:39 Well, content can fall into many different categories 
01:42 and what we're really going to focus on here is writing, 
01:45 particularly creating useful content that is accurate 
01:48 and helps out prospective customers. 
01:51 So for example, let's say I write a book on using Python, with Vim, 
01:54 I will write free information about how to set up your Vim plugins 
01:58 or how to tweak your syntax highlighting for Python, 
02:01 that way when people are searching 
02:03 for a solution to a problem they have about Vim,
02:05 they are likely to stumble upon my site 
02:08 and if they have stumbled upon it several times, 
02:10 they may say well "what else could this provide me 
02:12 that may make it easier for me to use Python with Vim?" 
02:14 Content marketing provides the first touch point 
02:17 with prospective customers to your product. 
02:19 The main thing to remember is that you're helping prospective customers,
02:23 you are not sales-pitching them, you don't lead with "here is my product, 
02:25 use it, buy it", you're assisting them solving the problem that they have 
02:29 using information, and once you write this content, 
02:31 you're going to use search engine optimization in order to make sure 
02:34 that content is more likely to be found, so these two concepts work together, 
02:37 you're creating content that will be used for marketing 
02:41 so that people can discover you and you will use some basic principles of SEO
02:44 in order to make sure that content appears higher in the search rankings, 
02:47 so what are we going to cover in this chapter, 
02:49 first off, when you break down an HTML page, 
02:52 there is certain elements that explain to Google what that page is about, 
02:55 and this has been true of any search engine, 
02:57 since the start of the World Wide Web, the title tag, the H1 tags, meta descriptions. 
03:02 Titles and H1s have been around since the very beginning 
03:05 and meta descriptions are more recent, 
03:07 but each of these is an indicator to Google what your content is about, 
03:10 search engines also have a preference on content length and the clarity of the text. 
03:15 There are many complicated algorithms on Google side or on Microsoft side, 
03:19 when they search an index or content you don't really have to worry about that, 
03:22 all you have to do is make sure that the content length is appropriate 
03:25 and that your writing is clear, it's appropriate for the audience that you're writing for. 
03:29 Url structure is also important for search engine optimization, 
03:32 what is better for you as a user, if URL contains the exact keywords 
03:37 that you're searching for so that you can remember 
03:40 what you're even reading when you just look at the URL itself, 
03:43 or a hash with a bunch of random digits,
03:46 so we'll cover what makes a good URL structure, 
03:48 so you can make sure that your site follows a certain practice 
03:51 that is going to be most optimal for search engines to index; 
03:54 and we'll also cover site loading times, page size, mobile support, 
03:56 these are all particularly important as people read more on their phones, 
04:00 less on the desktop, 
04:02 your site and the content that you create should support any type of reading habit, 
04:05 through the next few videos, we'll break down each of these concepts, 
04:08 using Full Stack Python as an example and then you can apply that 
04:11 to your own projects to make your content more appealing 
04:14 and more likely to be found by prospective customers.

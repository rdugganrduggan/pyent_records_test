00:00 So you got a list of keyword that you want to target, 
00:02 that you believe that prospective customers are going to be searching for in Google. 
00:06 You've set up some example titles, and expanded upon that with meta descriptions, 
00:09 and what about the content itself, let's think about the length of the content. 
00:14 How long should what you write be? 
00:16 Well, the right answer is whatever is most useful to your readers, 
00:20 you should know your audience better than anyone else, 
00:23 but let's get a little bit more specific than that. Take a look at some examples. 
00:26 Say I have written a new book on static site generation, 
00:30 one of my favorite topics, because I use a static site generator 
00:33 in order to create Full Stack Python. I want people 
00:36 who search for "python static sites" to come to my site. 
00:40 And here is Static Site Generator by Full Stack Python. If you click on it, 
00:44 it looks very similar to most of the other pages on the site, 
00:47 what makes the content on this page relevant for the audience? 
00:50 Well, it's broken down into a chunk of content length
00:53 there is just enough for someone to read in a few minutes, 
00:56 we've got our header here and then a short description of just what this is 
01:00 and then we expand upon some of the topics, in subsections 
01:04 that are going to be of interest to people that have searched for static sites, 
01:09 like for example why are static site generators useful
01:11 if you've never used one before and one of your developer friends says 
01:14 "hey, you should check out static site generators", you are going to wonder 
01:17 "why would I even want to use one, what is useful about them?"
01:21 So we describe a little bit about that, we have a few paragraphs, 
01:24 how do they work with an example, and as you can see, we're relevant, 
01:27 I've added pictures that reinforce some of the concepts 
01:33 that I am describing with the text. 
01:35 But the way that all this is broken down is that each section isn't actually that long, 
01:39 just two or three paragraphs, maybe a little bit longer if it's a really complicated topic, 
01:42 but it makes it easy for a reader to consume each subsection 
01:46 and they can skip over parts for example if they are not interested 
01:49 in Python implementations because they have already picked one,
01:53 they know they want to use MkDocs or Lektor, 
01:56 they can just skip over this one and they can scroll down 
01:58 to the rest of the information that is contained on the site. 
02:01 So overall, how long is this content? 
02:03 Well, I use a tool on the command line that is just the wc, 
02:06 the word count command and when we punch some text in, 
02:10 it's going to give us the length of that content. 
02:12 Remember that you can use the man command to get the manual, 
02:16 now let's use this on the content that makes up the static site generator page. 
02:21 We'll go into Full Stack Python and we'll go under pages, 
02:24 this one is under the web development chapter, 
02:27 and we can see 33-static-site-generator and we'll run that through the word count. 
02:31 Word count has 3 lines that are output, 
02:34 the first one is the number of lines contained in the file. 
02:37 This file has 217 lines, and this middle one is really what we are looking for, 
02:42 this page is about 1500 words long, that is typically right in the middle of the range, 
02:48 good size web page between a 1000 and 2000 words on a page. 
02:53 It can't just be a bunch of filler words, it has to be relevant to the topic at hand,
02:57 if you want a guideline on approximately how long each page should be
03:01 or if you bumped up against the maximum size of a page 
03:04 and you should break it into multiple pages, aim for about 1000 to 2000 words.
03:07 Finally, this third column is just a number of characters, 
03:11 I don't really have any recommendation around the number of characters 
03:14 I would just take a look at the words, so let's go back to this page 
03:18 and again just think through the content length. It's a good size page, 
03:21 again, about 1500 words, but it actually used to be much larger, 
03:25 and that's because I used to have sections for individual 
03:29 implementations of static site generators, now this page is
03:32 for the concept of static site generators, rather than specific implementations. 
03:37 Pelican is the implementation that I used to create Full Stack Python. 
03:40 If we search for Pelican I broke that out into its own page, 
03:44 now this page is fairly small and needs to be expanded upon, 
03:50 it doesn't have 1500 words, it's pretty much just the description, 
03:53 little additional information, and some further resources. 
03:57 And I'll expand upon this over time, but this is one way you can think 
04:01 about "how long should my content be?", make it about one specific topic, 
04:04 maybe that's a concept, some conceptual idea that you are writing about 
04:07 and then break out this specific implementations or the tools into their own pages, 
04:12 but as you are just starting, you may just want to keep all that on a single page 
04:15 if the contents that you're writing is not large enough. 
04:18 Think about your content as evolving over time, as you continue writing 
04:22 you may need to break things out to keep them focused on a specific topic. 
04:26 So that is the way that I think about content length, 
04:30 as approach has been successful for jumping up the rankings in the search results, 
04:34 there is certainly other approaches that you can take 
04:36 and you should develop your own approach, but when you're just getting started,
04:39 aim for your content to have a word length about 1000 and 2000 words 
04:42 and make it as useful as possible to your audience.

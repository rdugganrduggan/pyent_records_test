00:00 We need to talk about a couple of must-haves for the site that is hosting your content. 
00:04 HTTPS support and readability on mobile. 
00:07 Let's look at a couple of easy ways to do both. 
00:10 So Full Stack Python has HTTPS support, it's listed as a secure website, 
00:14 so everything looks good here. 
00:16 And this helps with the search engine rankings, 
00:19 Google has prioritized HTTPS connections over sites that do not support HTTPS, 
00:25 Full Stack Python is a static site, so the way I handle this is
00:27 I use a tool called Cloudflare, Cloudflare is a service you pay for monthly
00:33 and you can set your DNS records so that the Cloudflare 
00:36 will serve up your site through an HTTPS connection. 
00:39 It also has some nice benefits where it will minify your HTML CSS and JavaScript 
00:44 and in general, it will just make your site faster. 
00:46 But this is what I use in order to easily add HTTPS to Full Stack Python. 
00:49 Of course, you could set up your own HTTPS certificate 
00:52 that actually is the route that I would recommend for most applications, 
00:55 but if you want to slap Cloudflare in front of your application 
00:58 so you can have HTTPS support from day 1, that is also one possibility.
01:01 So yes, you need to have HTTPS support 
01:03 and that will help you in the search rankings. 
01:06 Another thing is support on mobile devices, and as we showed earlier, 
01:09 you can test this by using the mobile emulator in Chrome, 
01:12 your site should look good on mobile devices, and not just good, 
01:15 it should be completely readable and the way that you would accomplish this 
01:18 is through responsive design, Full Stack Python is based on Bootstrap version 3 
01:22 which has responsive design built right into it, 
01:25 and I recommend using a CSS framework 
01:27 that just has responsive design built into it, 
01:29 use that as you are building your site up. 
01:32 So we can see all this looks fine on whatever mobile device you are using, 
01:35 whether it's an iPhone, or a Galaxy S, any of those. 
01:39 One reason why this is so important right now, is that Google changed their index,
01:43 so instead of it being desktop first, it's now mobile first, 
01:46 the search engine results on mobile devices are based 
01:50 on whether your site is mobile-friendly, if you are not mobile-friendly, 
01:53 you are going to take a huge penalty in the search rankings. 
01:56 So make sure whether your readers are on desktop or on mobile, 
01:59 they will have a great experience. 
02:01 Easiest way to do that is just with the responsive design 
02:04 rather than a separate mobile site and a separate desktop website, 
02:07 so those are two must haves, HTTPS connection support and responsive design
02:10 so that anyone can access your site easily on a mobile device.

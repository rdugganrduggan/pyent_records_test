00:00 SEO and content marketing make it more likely 
00:03 that prospective customers are going to come across your business. 
00:06 Let's take a look at Full Stack Python as an example 
00:08 for each of the topics that we're going to cover in this chapter.
00:11 I am just going to walk through the process that I use 
00:14 and point out some non-intuitive points which we'll dive into throughout the chapter. 
00:17 You can follow along by just opening up an incognito browser 
00:21 either in Firefox or Chrome, the reason why we're using incognito is 
00:24 because Google tailors the search for your search history,
00:28 which can throw off your results compared to someone else who is searching. 
00:31 This is not an exact science, some of your customers 
00:34 are already going to have a search history but we use incognito mode 
00:37 to provide a baseline for searching for common terms and keywords 
00:40 that you believe your customers are going to be searching for. 
00:43 Let's take a look at a couple of examples, so my book on Python deployments, 
00:46 typically goes along with web development, 
00:49 so if someone searches for "python web development", 
00:52 I want my website with good quality content
00:55 that is going to help that user to appear first, organically. 
00:58 And that is the first thing that we're going to see here, 
01:00 we can't necessarily get the top spot on Google, 
01:03 because what you can see is that an ad appears on top, 
01:06 from one to four ads can appear on every Google search, 
01:09 there is nothing we can really do about that 
01:11 unless we want to pour a lot of money into adwords. 
01:12 What we are really targeting here with content marketing 
01:15 is the organic search results, and that is what we can see here,
01:18 web development for Full Stack Python appears first in this list of search results. 
01:23 A couple of things we can see about this, 
01:25 number one, we've got the full title for this web page, 
01:28 we've got the specific URL including bolded parts of the URL 
01:33 that matches our search terms, "python web development". 
01:36 That is an indicator, not only to Google but for the searcher 
01:39 that this web page is exactly the content that they are looking for 
01:43 and then we have a short description down here, web development,
01:46 they catch-all term for activities, and learn more in Full Stack Python, 
01:49 it has bolded the search terms, now if we click on this result, 
01:52 it's going to bring up obviously the page, and now we're on Full Stack Python, 
01:56 now on this page in particular, I have an advertisement 
01:59 for the Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments,
02:02 it's just the first way that someone can see that there is a deployment book 
02:05 that is related to the search term, but it's not in their face, 
02:08 there is no pop up, they can pretty much ignore if they want to, and that's fine,
02:12 what is really important here is the content that is going to help them
02:15 solve whatever problem they have, web development is very broad term 
02:18 so the problem that they have is probably they just want to know what it is, 
02:21 maybe someone told them about using Python for web development 
02:25 and they wanted to learn more about how Python is used for web development 
02:28 and this is one of the first things with content marketing, 
02:31 you do need to make some assumptions about what problem you're solving 
02:34 when you're creating a piece of content, sometimes it will be obvious, 
02:37 if you're solving a specific stack trace error in someone's application, 
02:43 obviously there is a solution based on the set of steps that you could take, 
02:46 that solve that problem, and fix the stack trace. 
02:48 In this case, we're really just providing information about web development, 
02:51 so there is a couple of key pieces here and I am going to pull up a Chrome developer tools. 
02:54 Let's highlight this header tag, this H1 tag, it's web development,
03:01 and this pulls up the source code down here. 
03:03 You should only have a single H1 tag on a page, that is one of the first rules.
03:07 Because the H1 tag is an indicator of what this webpage is about, 
03:11 let's scroll through here, and we can see 
03:14 that we've got a bunch of description that explains
03:17 how Python fits into web development and then provides more resources. 
03:20 And to be honest, this is not actually one of the better pages on Full Stack Python, 
03:23 it's much shorter in content length than it should be, 
03:27 but it at least provides a starting point for Python web development 
03:30 and since this is a very broad search term, 
03:33 it's likely that is one of the reason why it appears at the top of Google. 
03:36 In addition, it has all the terms that people are looking for 
03:40 related to Python web development and there are many links to other pages 
03:44 with concepts such as web frameworks and specific web frameworks in Python 
03:48 that again are an indicator to Google or any search engine 
03:52 that this is a good page on web development. 
03:55 Now we've run this search in a desktop web browser, 
03:58 but not everyone is going to be reading or searching for content on the desktop, 
04:02 they may also want to find it when they are on the mobile phone, 
04:05 commuting to work, something like that, so let's open up a new a tab 
04:08 and we'll again open up a developer tools 
04:10 and here is a little trick for searching on mobile 
04:13 when you are just in your own development environment on your laptop. 
04:16 Click this little icon down here, and now we've gone 
04:18 into the mobile simulator on Chrome.
04:21 And we can simulate searches from different phones, 
04:24 and what typically this is used for is seeing how your website looks in various browsers. 
04:29 It's really helpful for when you're doing your development work 
04:32 you can say "well, how does this look on an iPad, how does this look an an iPhone?" 
04:35 And the answer should always be "it looks awesome!" 
04:38 It looks just as good as the desktop version, 
04:40 because people are searching both on mobile and on desktop 
04:42 and you want to support both. 
04:44 And you can do that by making sure that your CSS, 
04:47 which you learned about earlier, is following responsive design. 
04:50 Now let's try this search term again, on the iPhone 6, simulating the iPhone 6. 
04:53 And we can still search up top here, we can say "python web development", 
05:03 now it's a little small, so let's bump up the size here. 
05:06 Now we can see there is two ads, 
05:10 and then again, Python web development pops up. 
05:14 Now the layout is a little bit different here, instead of the full URL 
05:18 we're seeing almost a categorization but this actually still follows the URL, 
05:22 saying the site is Full Stack Python and it's one level deep. 
05:26 When we click on it, we'll see that there is, and this is the URL structure, 
05:31 it's at the base URL, there is no subfolder for example
05:35 if we were to say blog in here, it's not under the blog subfolder, 
05:40 it is just one level deep on Full Stack Python. 
05:44 Now how does this look on mobile? It looks pretty good 
05:48 compared to the desktop version, we've taken away the sidebar, or actually 
05:51 the sidebar is down below, below all the choices so if we scroll all the way down, 
05:55 then we'll see the advertisement, for the Guide to Deployments book, 
06:00 the email updates and then we have chapters, 
06:03 now the one thing about the chapter is instead of listing everything out, 
06:06 like we can see over here, we have every single topic, 
06:10 that is listed out on the desktop version, which is fine on the desktop 
06:14 in case you want to just quickly bounce over to different topic. 
06:18 On mobile, that is a real pain in the butt, the way that I've designed this is 
06:21 just show the high level chapters, so when you click on any of these,
06:24 you'll see you can get immediately to that chapter 
06:30 and then you would have to click on all topics 
06:33 if you want to go to a drill down page such as postgres. 
06:36 So the general theme is, think about the topics 
06:39 that your users are going to be searching for, 
06:42 if you built a business related to selling vacuum cleaners, 
06:45 you wouldn't create Python content, you would create content about 
06:48 what the best vacuum cleaners are, 
06:51 or common solutions to fix an issue with your vacuum cleaner, 
06:54 like how to clean the bag in the vacuum cleaner, things like that. 
06:57 So you'd write content, that is going to solve the problems of that user. 
07:00 Let's take a look at one more thing and we'll do that 
07:03 by doing the view source on the web development page, 
07:06 I want to point out some important elements on this page, 
07:09 that we're going to dive into further in the next few videos. 
07:12 Now you already know I'll write HTML and there is some important elements here, 
07:17 one of which the meta description, meta name="description", 
07:21 is not actually a required element on a web page, 
07:23 but it's really important because this is what often sets the description 
07:28 that people see when they search for a specific term, 
07:32 so again, "python web development" and we can see, 
07:36 web development catch all term, if we look at the meta description 
07:39 this actually matches exactly 
07:42 what is in this meta description and the search results.
07:46 Now that is not guaranteed to happen, but if you put the right terms 
07:49 into the meta description it's likely that this is what is going to pop up 
07:53 as the description on the search results page. 
07:56 A couple of other things, one is the title, and it's a unique title, 
07:59 that is specific to this particular page, web development on Full Stack Python, 
08:05 so it has these search terms that are commonly associated with this, 
08:09 in the title itself, and then the title is very similar to the H1 tag 
08:13 but the H1 tag has just the header that has exactly what this page is on, 
08:17 let's take a look at one more example. 
08:20 Let's say we want to write a book or some guide on monitoring 
08:23 and we want people to be able to find monitoring. 
08:26 Now, I have a page on that as well, and you will see it follows the same pattern 
08:29 as the other one, we have a nice, clean H1 tag, good URL structure, 
08:34 that is not too deeply nested in a bunch of subfolders, 
08:37 and again, we have a bunch of useful information 
08:40 along with links to other projects and services that are going to be useful 
08:44 for someone who is searching for monitoring for a Python application. 
08:47 Let's talk about a few things that I have not done on here.
08:51 First off, if we take a look again at the web development page, 
08:55 this is not an H1 tag, if we had this top banner as an H1 tag 
09:01 there would be two H1 tags on the page and that would confuse 
09:05 not only the person who have visited that page 
09:07 but it would also confuse the search engine as to what exactly is 
09:11 the content that is on this page, so this is just a link 
09:14 and it's styled with a larger font, but it is not the H1 tag. 
09:18 Another bit that is important here is that this page when we go to the source 
09:22 it's very simple lightweight amount of HTML and other related content, 
09:27 for example, the CSS is minified, which means 
09:32 that it's all compressed down together in a single line 
09:34 or as close to a single line as possible 
09:37 and it's been hand tuned to make sure it's as fast as possible
09:40 and there is no JavaScript outside of one addition here 
09:44 and that is just Google analytics, 
09:46 so we do have a Google analytics snippet here 
09:48 but it loads at the very end of when the page loads 
09:51 because it's in the last element that appears right before the close of the body, 
09:54 there is no other jQuery or React or Angular, nothing like that on this page, 
09:59 which means that it loads extremely fast and site speed is really important
10:03 for appearing higher up in the search results. 
10:06 So that is a quick overview with a couple of example pages 
10:09 and example queries, where in my case with Full Stack Python 
10:12 it's advantageous to appear at the top of the search results for these search terms. 
10:16 So, it's going to depend on what your business is, who your audience is, 
10:19 so you're going to want to write down a bunch of the search terms 
10:22 that you want your site and your content to appear at the top, 
10:26 and then you can start writing on that topic. 
10:28 If you write consistent, clear, accurate and really useful information, 
10:32 over time, your content will begin to appear higher up in the search rankings, 
10:36 and that is pretty much what SEO is all about, there is no dark arts here, 
10:40 it's just a structured set, a fairly simple activities 
10:42 to make sure that you have a clear set of keywords for your content.

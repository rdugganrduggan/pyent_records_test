00:02 So you can see, here I am on my account page 
00:04 and we can only access that if you are logged in, 
00:08 However, the main navigation does not indicate whether or not I am logged in
00:12 and of course we want that to change, so let's take the information that our controllers know, 
00:17 about the user, whether or not they are logged in 
00:19 and let's push that on to the master view here. 
00:22 So we come down to, let's get this out of our way, don't need that, 
00:26 come down here to our shared layout, and not far down, 
00:30 we have our navigation bit, about sign in and register. 
00:33 And let's go over here and do a conditional so we'll say tal:condition, 
00:37 now we actually already have access to the controller, 
00:42 now the reason that we have access to it is we have this base controller 
00:47 and we are guaranteed every single request that runs through Python
00:50 is running through that base controller in some way or another. 
00:54 So it's doing good stuff for us here, so what we are going to do is 
00:57 we say if it's not the case that the view remember that's Pyramid's terminology 
01:01 for the view...the controller, is the way we structured it and what did we call this, 
01:06 we called this like logged_in_user or something like that, 
01:09 logged_in_user_id, as a property. 
01:11 So if it's not the case that there is a valid logged in user, 
01:15 then we want to show a sign in and we also want to show register. 
01:19 but we're going to have an alternate version for when you are signed in. 
01:22 This is going to be log out, let's do account here, and maybe just like this, 
01:29 and this will be log out, I don't think we've written log out yet but we're going to. 
01:38 OK, so if the user is signed in, you should see this,
01:42 if the user is not signed in, you should see the sign in features.
01:45 So, let's go over here and refresh this, remember, we're signed in right now 
01:49 boom, sign in, log out, but if we open it in a private browsing session, 
01:53 sign in / register, if we do sign in / register, then we are signed in. 
01:57 Beautiful, right. 
01:59 Check that the account works, log out, it's not found yet, let's go write that.

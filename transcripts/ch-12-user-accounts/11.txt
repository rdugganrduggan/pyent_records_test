00:01 Now that we've seen we can successfully set the auth cookie, 
00:04 we can read it back and use that to check whether or not 
00:07 we should consider the person logged in. 
00:09 So let's run another function down here in our cookie_auth module, 
00:13 called get_user_id_via_auth_cookie. 
00:16 And we're only going to need the request for this, 
00:22 so what we're going to do is, we're going to read this back in,
00:24 now, we are not quite there, we don't quite want to leave this one alone here, 
00:29 we are going to make some changes but let's go ahead 
00:32 and keep working with this for just a minute. 
00:34 What we want to do is we want to read in this cookie here 
00:37 so we are going to startup by just checking to see whether or not there is a cookie. 
00:43 So we are going to see, we'll ask the question, 
00:45 is the auth cookie in the dictionary of this thing called cookies, 
00:49 if it's not, which is what we are going to check for, 
00:53 we are going to return None, so nope, there is nobody logged in here, no cookie. 
00:58 Great. But if it is here, then we can get its value. 
01:04 So remember that string we generated up here, we got it back, 
01:08 but want we want to do is we want to verify this thing and sort of use 
01:13 this check and again, I am going to change what we are hashing up here 
01:16 before we're done, so we are able to basically treat this as a string now 
01:20 and do whatever it is we want to verify, so let's say we have parts 
01:25 is going to be val.split and we want to split on that colon we added, 
01:29 and if we'll say the parts. the length of the parts 
01:33 is not equal to two, something went wrong. 
01:37 So we are going to return None, right, so there is something wrong with this login cookie here. 
01:42 So then we have the user_id is going to be parts[0]
01:48 and the hash value it's going to be parts[1].
01:51 So we just want to check that if we rerun this procedure, 
01:55 everything is going to come out the same as we expected 
01:58 so let's go over here, and the procedure was 
02:01 that we would come over and hash the user id, which look, 
02:05 they called that the same, 
02:07 and then we want to give this hash value check and then we want to say "if not...",
02:11 "if hash value is not equal to hash value check" then we're going to return None
02:16 but we're also going to do a little message here, so we can keep track 
02:20 of what is going on, we'll say "Warning: Hash mismatch, invalid cookie value", 
02:27 something like this, OK. 
02:30 Alright, but if they do check, there was no sort of sticking user ids
02:34 in the cookies and hoping that we can just log in with them, 
02:36 instead we are going to get this back and we can just return user id, OK, 
02:42 so this is pretty solid, we should be able to use this, 
02:45 let's go over to our account controller, when we set this, 
02:49 this is going to set it but other requests 
02:51 like maybe this one for the account page, 
02:54 we don't want unauthenticated people go to an account, 
02:57 we want to make sure they are logged in. 
02:59 We could add a function here to work directly with that cookie auth 
03:02 but it turns out maybe the albums controller for purchases needs to know 
03:06 who is logged in, the home controller all sorts of things, 
03:09 the whole app needs to know. So we can go to our base controller 
03:12 and give it some properties, like we have a property there, 
03:15 we'll give it another one and this one is going to be logged in user id.
03:20 And here we are going to use the cookie also, let me import it up here like so.
03:29 So down here, we'll just return cookie_auth.get_user_via_auth_cookie(self.request). 
03:39 Alright, so that will let us ask questions like this, if we go over here, 
03:44 we'll say "if not self.logged_in_user_id, that's a property so if we don't have one, 
03:50 we'll print "Cannot view account page, must log in", 
03:55 and then we'll do a self.redirect to /account/signin, right, 
04:05 so we'll have them sign in and if there is no problem, if they are authenticated,
04:08 then we just display this basically empty page for now. 
04:12 Alright, so let's try this. 
04:15 So if we go over here, and we go to this page, 
04:18 let's get rid of this thing, you can see we have the cookie right now, 
04:21 so if I hit this it should stay, great, everything worked, 
04:24 now, if I take the same thing, the same page and try to view it 
04:28 in a private browsing session, let's go here, not signed in, 
04:33 notice that we were not signed in, and it redirect us over here. 
04:38 Right, this one it says refresh it all we want, we are staying signed in, 
04:42 go over to this one and obviously if we try to go to account, 
04:46 we are signing in, we could sign in, and now it will let us in. 
04:50 Alright, so you can see that we're signing in we're still not managing this 
04:53 but let's come back and do that in a separate little section here.

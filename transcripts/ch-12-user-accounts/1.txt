00:02 There is a very good chance that you are going to need 
00:05 to manage user accounts as part of your online business.
00:08 It could be that you just put them on your mailing list and you email them things 
00:11 and they do transactional purchases or something to this effect.
00:15 But for most businesses, we want to have users come back to our site, 
00:18 have an account, be able to log in and have access to things. 
00:22 And if that's the case, we're going to need to talk about 
00:25 how you create model and store user accounts. 
00:28 Not just how do you make it happen, but how do you do it securely, 
00:31 and in a way that is really delightful for the users. 
00:35 Well the first question you want to ask yourself is: 
00:38 is this is a "do it yourself problem" or a SaaS problem? 
00:41 That is, should you manage these users yourself in your database 
00:44 or should you subscribe to some SaaS, software as a service system 
00:49 that can do identity as a service, and we'll talk about both options, 
00:53 but we're going to start by covering the "do it yourself" story 
00:56 and then I'll show you a SaaS option that is really good. 
00:59 Like everything we put in our database 
01:01 we're going to need to model users in SQLAlchemy, 
01:04 we want to create our user or account class that map that to the database, 
01:07 so we'll see how to do this in a way that is secure as well as high-performance, 
01:13 so make sure we have the right indexes and uniqueness constraints and things like that.
01:17 We're going to talk about the importance of strong password hashes, 
01:21 it's hardly a week that goes by that you don't hear some major web application 
01:26 losing all of their user accounts, their database being dumped 
01:30 in one way or another for a variety of reasons. 
01:33 If you do things correctly, that will have no big impact in the world, right, 
01:37 it will be too hard for people to recover the passwords. 
01:40 But most sites do this wrong, luckily we're using Python 
01:43 which makes it really easy as you'll see. 
01:47 The thing that makes is easy is this library called passlib, 
01:50 so we're going to be using passlib to hash and manage the sort of encrypted 
01:54 one-way hashed elements in our database. 
01:57 And primarily that is going to be our passwords. 
02:01 And finally, we'll talk a little bit about Stormpath. 
02:04 So, steps two, three and four, this is the "do it yourself" style, 
02:07 step five, they have identity as a service 
02:10 so we'll talk just a bit about them as well.

00:02 We could go about using this cookie_auth module 
00:06 throughout the whole application, 
00:08 but because most of the time we are going to begin working with users, 
00:12 at the level of the controllers or the web action methods, 
00:15 it makes a lot of sense to me to add a few properties to the base controller 
00:19 so that throughout our entire application as we add new controllers and everything, 
00:23 we always have access to this logged in user 
00:27 and we don't even have to think about it. 
00:29 So we can add two properties, in this case, 
00:32 we are going to add one called is_logged, 
00:34 before we had the logged in id and in this slide I guess
00:37 I decided you don't really need the id unless you really want to know the user itself, 
00:40 so here is just a bollean you can test is user logged in, 
00:43 and to compute it it's super easy, we go to our cookie auth, 
00:46 we say get the user by the auth cookie, and if that returns something, 
00:49 hey they are logged in, if it's None, 
00:52 which the cookie is not there or it's tampered with or something, then it is None. 
00:55 So then they are not logged in. So, that's a really easy thing we can test with, 
00:59 if we want the actual user itself, we can use the property logged_in_user, 
01:04 which will get the user id from the cookie_auth layer, 
01:07 it will check to see whether or not it's a value, right, 
01:10 if there is nobody there, nobody logged in, no id, then just return no user as well, 
01:13 but if there is a user id, let's go to the account service, 
01:16 do a SQLAlchemy query to the database and retrieve that account, 
01:19 Once you have this on the base controller, you have it on all of the views, right,
01:22 so then in our layout template, we can actually do a tal conditional 
01:27 to change what shows up in our navigation. 
01:30 So here we did a tal condition "not view.is_logged_in, 
01:33 and a tal conditional "view.is_logged_in. 
01:36 So, when they are not logged in we see sign in / register, 
01:39 when they are logged in, they see account and log out.

00:01 We have an account class but we don't have an account table.
00:04 Now remember, all we should have to do is run this app, 
00:08 it will know what derives from this, it's SqlAlchemyBase 
00:12 and it's going to add the table, remember if the table exists, it won't update it, 
00:16 but if it doesn't exist it will create it. 
00:19 But it's not going to work, I want to just remind you why. 
00:22 Run this, OK, it looks like it's running, fantastic, if we refresh and- no,
00:28 let's go back over here to our db session, remember this business, 
00:32 where we had to import these things, 
00:34 well, we need to do that again, and for account.
00:38 Now if I run it, what this is doing is making sure we have that 
00:42 before we call create_all on our SqlAlchemyBase, 
00:45 the SqlAlchemyBase has seen the account, so run that again, 
00:49 over here, a little refresh. 
00:52 Yay, we have an account class with all the things we'd like. 
00:56 We have our text id, we have our email with the uniqueness, 
00:59 with the constraint, and with an index, 
01:02 and some constraints over here as well.

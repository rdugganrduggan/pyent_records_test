00:02 Here is the account class we created, it's called Account, obviously, 
00:06 and it derives from SqlAlchemyBase and it has a __tablename__
00:09 that matches the type name, just like all of our entities do, 
00:13 we're going to give it an id, a created date, whether or not that user is a super user 
00:17 and then the ability to log in via email and a password, remember, hashed password. 
00:23 Now, the id is a little bit different, remember we didn't want to leak 
00:27 how many users we had or let people poke around by guessing their user id, right, 
00:33 like "mine is 100, what's at 101? Who knows, 
00:36 let's go poke around and see if we can find that." 
00:39 So we are making this a string, and we created a default function, 
00:42 which is a lambda that just returns the uuid4 as text, 
00:47 so it'll be a nice big alphanumeric thing that we can't guess easily 
00:52 and of course don't forget to set it to be the primary key. 
00:55 We also might want to run reports on "hey, how many users were created today? 
01:00 How many users were created this year?" and so on. 
01:03 So we created a datetime column, now in my demo I realized I created a date, 
01:07 not a datetime and I went and updated it, notice, we probably want the minutes, 
01:10 hours, minutes and seconds, so datetime, not date 
01:13 and then we are going to set that to be the default of datetime.datetime.now 
01:18 without parenthesis, OK?
01:20 Then we want to give a little bit of permissions management, 
01:25 very basic to our account here, and whether or not this user is a super user 
01:29 and they have access to do all sorts of interesting additional high-privilege things 
01:34 in our site or if they are just a regular user 
01:37 and they could only access what regular users can do. 
01:40 So we set that as a boolean but by default it's False, 
01:43 we also wanted this to give the ability to log in, so basically 
01:48 as far as the user is concerned, their credentials are their email address, 
01:52 don't need a name and an email, if you are going to get an email anyway 
01:55 just use that as the user id. Or as their ability to log in, right. 
02:00 So have their email here, and of course that has to be unique, 
02:04 we want to do searches by it, so index is True, and it can't be null. 
02:08 Also, we're not going to store the password, 
02:11 we're going to store the password hash as a string, 
02:13 it's very important to not store passwords, 
02:15 and we'll talk about a couple of solutions on this.

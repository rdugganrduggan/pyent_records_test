00:02 There are a number of companies out there 
00:04 that will basically be the backend for your mailing list. 
00:08 But the first thing I want to say is: Don't build this yourself, 
00:11 it's easy to think "well, I know how to send email out of Python 
00:16 or out of my web app or somehow, I could setup my own server and I can do this", 
00:21 it's not going to turn out as well as you think, 
00:24 there is way more going on in these email systems than you think. 
00:28 So first of all, setting up just a valid email server with the right MX records, 
00:33 making sure it doesn't get onto a spam list, blacklist, 
00:38 and it just starts not showing up, these are all really hard, 
00:41 I've had friends who setup email servers 
00:43 and their mail just go straight to my Gmail spam,
00:46 because there is something wrong with their email setup, 
00:49 it's just not trusted, right, so that is not super easy, 
00:52 the spam rules and laws around the world are complex 
00:56 and you'd rather have somebody help you with that, right, 
00:59 like for example there is the US CAN-SPAM Act, 
01:02 there is a lot of rules around that, but that's just United States, 
01:06 there is many countries right, maybe they have their own spam rules, 
01:09 there's subscribe and more importantly unsubscribe, 
01:12 when people become uninterested,
01:14 functionality you have to implement this, 
01:18 segmentation and by segmentation I mean breaking your users into various stages, 
01:22 you'll hear people talk about acquisition funnels and customer funnels, right, 
01:27 people who are new users versus people maybe have signed up to your newsletter 
01:32 but they haven't actually bought anything, people who are paying customers, 
01:35 people who are repeat customers, you can use these mail systems 
01:38 to categorize your contacts, your email list into these different groups 
01:42 so if you want to have a special followup just for second-time buyers, 
01:46 you could do that easily with what I am going to show you, 
01:49 you would have to build that yourself. 
01:51 Reporting, analytics, like who has opened the emails? Were they delivered? 
01:56 Did they bounce? There is just tons of that so you don't want to get involved in this, 
02:01 A/B testing, trying slight variations over time on your emails 
02:05 to see what works better and improving over time, 
02:08 getting help so if you are going to hire somebody to come work with you,
02:11 right, find the consultant or something to help you work 
02:14 with your marketing angle. If you say "oh and I have this totally custom thing I built", 
02:18 and they are kind of like: "What? I don't know if that is a good idea", 
02:21 if you say "hey I use MailChimp" or "I use GetResponse" or something like that, 
02:24 like OK, great, I know how it works, I can work with that. 
02:28 There is a lot of automation and workflow as you'll see, we'll talk a bit about that. 
02:33 But, you can do things like well, 30 minutes after a purchase, send this email, 
02:37 and then if they click this button, then send them this email two days later, 
02:42 if you want to setup that kind of automation or workflow you have to build that, 
02:45 there is just lots and lots of reasons you don't want to build this yourself. 
02:48 So what we want to do is look at a couple of options we have 
02:51 for getting the software as a service type thing to plug into our app as an API. 
02:57 So we are going to be using MailChimp,
03:01 I've been using MailChimp for a long time, it's a solid, 
03:04 good, well known, well understood platform. 
03:08 They have a nice free tier as you'll see, right here it says sign up for free 
03:12 and it's pretty generous, so we'll be doing that in a little bit. 
03:16 So as we go through this course, this section we're definitely going to be working 
03:19 with MailChimp, I want to show you some other options because MailChimp is fine 
03:23 but you can pick whatever you want. 
03:26 Another option that looks really good to me is customer.io 
03:29 so this is similar to MailChimp but it has a lot more tracking and automation 
03:34 and kind of those rules that I talked about, right, 
03:37 if they click this button then do this thing in two hours and so on. 
03:40 So customer.io is pretty cool. 
03:43 GetResponse is another one that works really good 
03:45 for email marketing, webinars, landing pages, 
03:48 this is a little bit more than just pure email, 
03:51 so it's kind of a bigger platform but you know,
03:54 marketing is its whole own thing and if you want to get into this, 
03:58 this is also a good choice.
04:01 I've also heard really good things about drip.co which is from Leadpages 
04:04 and Leadpages is a place where you can create landing pages
04:07 like that one I showed you in a previous video, actually, 
04:10 or more importantly, create a whole bunch of different landing pages 
04:14 you can run ads and drive people to do these various pages 
04:16 and do the A/B testing and so on, so this is a very powerful visual email automation system, 
04:22 to go behind those types of things, and I've heard this is really good as well. 
04:26 But, like I said, we are using MailChimp 
04:29 because that is what I am using and it works really well.

00:03 When you look at how businesses communicate with their customers, 
00:06 it's easy to think of social media. 
00:09 Here is a growing startup, it has 10 thousand Twitter followers, 
00:12 the YouTube channel with a million of views, 
00:14 a Facebook page with 50 thousand likes. 
00:17 These are all important. But, they are dwarfed by the power and importance 
00:21 of having an email list of qualified, engaged leads. 
00:26 So we are going to talk about how to build these email lists, 
00:30 how to integrate them into our website, 
00:32 some of the options for commercial places to manage them, 
00:35 send them, create campaigns and track reports, and so on. 
00:39 The first thing I want to tell you is that email lists are very valuable, 
00:43 now I am not talking about email lists that maybe people have gotten from
00:47 some place you can buy a bunch of emails 
00:49 and they are kind of filled with a bunch of people that don't care, 
00:51 but I am talking about people who have come to your webpage, 
00:53 like what you are doing enough to actually enter their email address into your site 
00:58 and say "hey, please email me when you have something interesting to say". 
01:02 Those are highly, highly valuable and convert far better than Twitter 
01:06 or Facebook or YouTube or these sorts of things. 
01:10 It's easy to miss that because you don't see email, 
01:13 you don't got o a company and see their email list, 
01:16 like you do see their Twitter followers for example, 
01:18 it's kind of the dark matter of marketing and outreach, 
01:22 but it's super important, so we are going to focus on it. 
01:25 In fact it's so important that a lot of companies, before they even launch, 
01:28 will create a landing page that is basically all you need to do is 
01:32 put your email here and we'll tell you when we launch.
01:35 So here is a company called Backpacker travel 2.0, they've since launched 
01:39 but this was their landing page back in 2015 and you can see, 
01:43 it has the title, one sentence about what they do 
01:47 and awesome new community for backpackers, 
01:50 and here: "notify me with your email" right here, OK, 
01:53 super simple, super important to build that list of really engaged 
01:58 and interested customers before they even launch. 
02:02 They also have social media, Facebook and Twitter, 
02:04 I would say probably the two most important, 
02:06 it's the email address that is the thing they are going after here. 
02:10 And I encourage you to do something like this before you launch your app as well. 
02:14 As soon as possible start to gather interested contact information, 
02:17 you'll get your domain out a little bit sooner, 
02:20 which will get it older in the search engines, 
02:24 which again helps in ranking it higher, 
02:26 but most importantly this will build your email list.

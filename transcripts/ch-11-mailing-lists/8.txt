00:02 Now what fun would it be to have a mailing list if you never mail it? 
00:05 So, the way you get started doing an email campaign, 
00:08 is you go to the "create campaign" section, 
00:10 I typically pick the regular campaign, which gives you a nice beautiful HTML designer,
00:14 you pick the list, if you did the segmentation thing I  talked about,
00:17 you pick the various segments you want it to apply to, 
00:20 there is all sorts of rules about dates and groups, 
00:23 and lots of powerful rules you can apply there. 
00:26 Then you design it out just the way you like it, you can do preview, 
00:29 you can do tests and then finally you hit boom send an out it goes to 
00:33 however many thousand people are in your list. 
00:36 My only advice is test this on yourself when you first get going, right, 
00:40 so make sure that you run through it to see what effect all the settings have there 
00:43 is a lot of choices that after you get used to it are really simple 
00:46 but are not necessarily obvious in the beginning, 
00:49 as well as make sure you proofread it, like you probably have all gotten 
00:51 some kind of email from me with like a missing period or some word repeated 
00:57 or something funky as you like write the copy and rewrite the copy 
01:00 and rewrite the copy because you want to get it just right, 
01:03 be sure to proofread it, you can send it to a friend and have them proofread it as well
01:06 through MailChimp before you actually send it out 
01:09 you can either send it right away or schedule it.
01:11 This is your time to shine, you've got these people interested in what you are doing, 
01:14 you set up the infrastructure to communicate with them, 
01:17 and now it's time to share your message.

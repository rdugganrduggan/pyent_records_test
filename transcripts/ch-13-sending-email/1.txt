00:02 Remember back in the mailing list section where I talked about sending email, 
00:06 how important email is for your business and communicating with your users? 
00:11 Well, MailChimp is great for things like newsletters 
00:14 and certain types of bulk emailing. 
00:17 However, sometimes you want to send one email to one person, 
00:21 things like "hey, I forget my password" or 
00:23 "thanks for creating an account", or things like that.
00:27 And I am going to show you how to add that capability
00:29 as well as accepting inbound email to your web application. 
00:32 You probably have all received at least one or two emails from my system,
00:36 here you see one, Talk Python Training, this is the email you get 
00:39 when you create an account for the very first time. 
00:42 You can see it has a nice HTML version with pictures and everything.
00:45 What you can't see is also there is a text version as well 
00:48 that is sent in parallel or sort of embedded within the same message. 
00:52 But like in the MailChimp section in the mailing list section, 
00:55 I told you you don't want to create your own email server 
00:57 and maintain and manage that. That's still true. 
01:00 So, what are we going to use to send outbound email? 
01:03 We are going to use AWS. So, Amazon has a really great service 
01:06 called Amazon SES or Simple Email Service. 
01:10 You can see if we take a step back one slide, look right at the top, 
01:13 it says Talk Python Training via Amazon SES, 
01:16 so you can  tell that was sent through SES on behalf of Talkpython.fm. 
01:21 So this is a simple email service, you just get SMTP server address, a port, 
01:25 a username and a password, you set that up in your web app, 
01:29 you create a standard Python SMTP client that can send email, 
01:34 and then you just start just sending HTML email, 
01:38 we'll talk about specifically how to do that, 
01:40 and we'll go into a demo to see how to do that, 
01:42 you might be wondering what does this AWS thing cost,
01:45 like "could I afford to use this, or would it just make more sense 
01:48 to actually create mailing server?" 
01:51 Now, realize that SES actually does anti-spam things, it tracks bounces for you, 
01:57 it helps all sorts of behind the thing stuff 
02:00 to make sure your email domain remains trusted. 
02:03 So what does this service cost? 
02:05 Well, as far as I am concerned, it's basically free, 
02:08 it costs 10 cents per 1000 emails, or 1 cent US dollars per hundred emails.
02:14 So, you can basically send as many emails as you want, 
02:18 if you have so many users and so many emails going per day, 
02:21 to register, you are going to have a thriving business.

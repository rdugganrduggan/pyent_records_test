00:01 OK, we have an active reset code, 
00:03 we have all the validation and details to pull it back from the database, 
00:06 final thing to do, set the password, use up the reset code. 
00:11 Let me open this in a second window here, there we go, so I can have the old one, 
00:16 and have it in two places, we can see that it gets used up again, 
00:21 OK, let's just do a bit of validation, we'll say "if vm.validate" 
00:26 we haven't called this method yet but does that return an error? No, it doesn't. 
00:31 So we'll just check for the error here. 
00:38 Now, when we do get this correct, we want to redirect, 
00:42 we don't want to redirect, we are just going to set the message, sorry.
00:45 So we are going to say vm.message= "Your password has been reset, please login.", 
00:52 something to that effect, and then we'll return vm.to_dict. 
00:57 OK, beautiful, now, what is left here? Well, actually doing the reset, 
01:03 so we'll say AccountService and we want to do a couple of things, right, 
01:08 remember this verified that we have a reset code that it is not expired, 
01:13 it exists, things like that, so we can go over here and just use that, 
01:17 so we have to do these two operations, and the order doesn't matter too much 
01:20 but let's use up the reset code first. 
01:23 So we'll say use_reset_code(vm.reset), which one do we want to pass? 
01:30 It doesn't really matter, let's just pass the code, keep the dependencies a little lower,
01:35 it's just a string rather than actual class, I want to add this method here, 
01:41 and so all we are going to do is we want to create a session, 
01:47 we want to get the reset code, and we'll say "if not reset: return", 
01:54 and then what we are going to do is we are just going to do a couple of things, 
01:57 we also need to set the user ip so you can see we have three things to set, 
02:02 the used_date, datetime.now, whether it was used, 
02:08 I could combine those like I said, and then we want to set this. 
02:11 Alright. So we are going to say our ip address is user_ip, was used is True, 
02:22 actually I get this exactly right, used_date=datetime..., right, 
02:36 so it was used now, and we don't want to forget to say session.commit. 
02:41 And this probably should be reset_code. 
02:47 OK, so what are we going to do? We are going to come in, we want to create a session, 
02:50 we are going to query for the code, yes we got it before 
02:52 but that was associated with this previous session, we got disconnected 
02:56 when we left very likely, so let's just get it again. 
03:01 We'll do a quick test to make sure in case some reason, 
03:03 somebody calls this with an invalid code, we are not going to crash by working with None,
03:08 and then we are going to basically use up this code, 
03:11 we are going to say that it was used by this ip address, on this date and yes it is used, 
03:14 and then we are going to call save, which will push that back, 
03:18 OK, that is step one, over here; step two will be set_password, 
03:26 we are going to set the password for a particular user, so let's get the account, 
03:31 we'll say AccountService.find_account_by_id, we have vm.reset, remember, 
03:42 we have a user_id foreign key constraint there. 
03:47 And I am not going to check if this account exists 
03:49 because there is a foreign key constraint here, so this should always map to something. 
03:55 So this should return something, maybe that is a bad assumption, we'll see. 
03:59 We'll say let's just pass the account id over here. 
04:14 OK, so this should actually be pretty easy, again, 
04:18 we are going to get something from the database 
04:21 and it's going to look really similar to this.
04:25 OK, so juggle this around a little, we are going to have plain text password, 
04:29 we are going to pass it in, and we are going to pass the account id, 
04:32 so we are going to get the account, and just again, 
04:34 this could be called somewhere else without the same validation, 
04:36 so let's just verify that this is not going to crash, 
04:40 and then all we have to do is go to the account and set the password hash,
04:44 remember, we don't want to set it to the plain text password, 
04:47 we are going to do this. 
04:49 But luckily, we already have this method, something about hashing text,
04:53 and we'll give it the plain text password, and then we just call session.commit. 
04:58 This is cool, this lets us set the password within code, any time we want to, 
05:04 it just happens to be right now we are doing this in the context of 
05:08 some kind of password reset workflow, 
05:11 maybe there is some other mechanism where we want to manually create an account 
05:14 and then set its password or I don't know, 
05:17 but this method will let us set passwords for any account whatsoever. 
05:21 Alright,  let's take this thing for a spin, rerun it, if we come over here, 
05:25 and let's just make sure everything is hanging together, 
05:29 let me just do a quick test, here, show my password is this and it was test, T-E-S-T. 
05:36 OK, great, come back and test that again in a minute, so I want to set it to "cat".
05:42 And, of course, remember I added that user ip well, we didn't pass it along, did we,
05:52 alright, so let's go ahead and pass it along, 
05:55 we can click here and get right back to it, 
05:56 so this is going to take the ip address, 
05:58 and we can actually get that from self.request.remote_addr, 
06:02 OK, try again, ready, let's just resubmit the form, 
06:07 and we should probably change this color, it's not super obvious here, 
06:12 maybe make a color, or make that a little more obvious, 
06:15 but "Your password has been rest, please login." 
06:18 Hey, I set it to "cat", let's try this again, so I am going to try my old password, 
06:27 "test", no that's incorrect, let me try the new one I just set, "cat". 
06:31 Alright, so it turns out that my try to login didn't work, why didn't it work, 
06:39 well, I had a bit of a mistake right here, check this out, 
06:43 AccountService.set_password, that's probably not the password I want to use, is it?
06:50 OK, let's actually set the password this way.
06:55 OK, I am going to set the password "cat", your password's been set, 
07:00 let's try the old one first, "test", no, let's try the new one now, "cat". 
07:05 Boom, we now have a new password, it is very secure it's called "cat".

00:02 Let's return to our account controller. 
00:05 Now, there is actually a bunch of small fiddly work that you have to do 
00:09 to get the password reset process in place, there is three different views,
00:14 let's go in our templates and I'll show you. 
00:17 So first of all, you need to update the sign in process, so next to the sign in, 
00:23 you could say something like "here is the login information... email, password, login", 
00:28 and then "Oh, did you forget your login? Click here to reset it." 
00:31 So then, that will take us over to this forgot_password view, 
00:34 this will let you enter your email address and say "I would like to reset my password", 
00:38 which will trigger the creation of a password reset in the database, 
00:42 and send you an email with that information that you can use. 
00:45 Then we also want to tell you "hey, we sent that to you correctly", 
00:49 so we have a reset_sent view, we could have just added that as a view 
00:56 to the forgot_password form and shown it only after it was submitted, 
01:00 but it's just about as easy to have to views as it is 
01:03 to have the conditional logic to make that happen. 
01:06 So we have this, and then finally there is a link that the person gets 
01:09 in their email address, when they get in their email address, 
01:12 they are going to click it and it is going to take them to a form, here, 
01:15 where they can actually enter their new password and it will reset it 
01:18 and then they can go log in. 
01:20 So, I went and put those forms together for you, 
01:23 there is nothing fancy, they are just like the log in forms and so on,
01:27 but there is no use in you watching me do that, right, 
01:29 you've done these forms over and over, so it's all good, 
01:32 you can review the code if you want and you'll see it in the demo. 
01:35 Now at the bottom of the account controller I added the corresponding action methods, 
01:39 and the view models, OK, so here is the forgot_password form, right, 
01:43 this tells you what it does, we've got the GET / POST /Redirect pattern, 
01:48 we are not redirecting yet, we will, it's got the ForgotPassWordViewModel
01:53 that has a few pieces of information like what is your email address and things like that. 
01:57 Then of course we have the basic reset_sent and then we have the form 
02:01 to do the actual reset itself. 
02:04 OK. But, notice, these don't really do anything, other than just hold the data. 
02:08 So our job will be to create the table in the database so it manages the reset password, 
02:13 set up the code to do the resets and send the emails. 
02:17 Oh yes, and over in the email section here, 
02:20 we now have a template for password reset, here, 
02:23 and let's just view this in the browser, here you can see this is a basic-looking one,
02:29 this is just one of those template emails we already talked about, 
02:33 so we heard about your password at Blue / Yellow rockets, remember,
02:37 this is an image and I haven't changed it, 
02:40 we are just going to go with that image for now. 
02:42 If you click this button to reset it, it's going to take you to this URL 
02:45 which is where things are running. 
02:48 And then it's going to say account/reset_password 
02:51 and then we are going to replace the reset code 
02:53 with whatever the reset code that we generate for them is. 
02:57 Alright, so that's the plan, let's put it into action.

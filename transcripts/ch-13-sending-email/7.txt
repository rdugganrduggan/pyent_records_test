00:02 We've seen that sending templated emails that is a plain HTML file 
00:07 with a few little replacement pieces of text in here is incredibly easy in Python. 
00:13 So, here is a fragment from the email template I use 
00:17 when you purchase a course from me at Talk Python Training. 
00:21 So I need to send you things like how do you get back to the course you just bought, 
00:25 how much did you pay for it, what date was it purchased on, 
00:28 what was your email, how did you pay, things like that. 
00:31 So, you can imagine the rest of the formatting that you already saw, 
00:34 stick this right in the middle and that is pretty much what you get. 
00:38 So I'll use a dictionary with the course URL fragment set, the course price, 
00:43 already formatted, I typically format that to a string in Python 
00:47 and send it over like 69.00 or just 69, however you want it to appear, 
00:52 so you don't rely on the string, 
00:57 sort of string representation of whatever it is you pass across. 
01:00 Similarly with the purchase date text, I'll actually create a string 
01:03 exactly the way I'd like it to look, in Python and then just pass that, 
01:08 ultimately that string in the dictionary and so on.
01:11 So this is really easy, how do we load this up and actually send it? 
01:15 This method sort of combines two of the things we did, 
01:18 it's a little harder to use but if we want to get a template from a file 
01:22 so we'd pass in the HTML file name in a replacement dictionary, 
01:27 and we'll just read the text in, not all emails are going to have a replacement, 
01:31 like maybe you are going to send "hey, thanks for signing up" 
01:34 and that is the same for everybody, you don't have to pass like some dictionary, 
01:37 you can just send, just return the HTML. 
01:40 But if we do have a replacement dictionary, we are going to use
01:44 my little curly syntax {some text name} 
01:47 and we'll just do a replace, straight up string replace on all the keys in the dictionaries 
01:52 with their various values and return it. 
01:54 And that is it, you are sending HTML email out of files that you can manage separately 
02:00 that are not in code, that are not in a database, that are very simple for people 
02:03 who are not programmers or just want to use design tools 
02:06 like HTML editors on it.

00:02 You are going to want a professional-looking email address 
00:05 for your contact page and for your communications. 
00:08 Here on training.talkpython.fm you can contact me, just go to the bottom 
00:12 and click on contact and right here it says all you got to do is 
00:16 you can find us on Twitter or send us an email at contact@talkpython.fm. 
00:20 How do we do that? 
00:23 Well, it used to be you could use things like Google Apps 
00:26 and just create a free accounts there and set those up as custom domains 
00:29 and that went away a few years ago. 
00:32 So, I could setup my own server but I have already gone through this two times, 
00:35 don't set up your own email server, here is the third time, 
00:38 don't set up your own email server, 
00:40 I'll show you a service that is amazing for this kind of stuff. 
00:44 OK, so I own the domain talkpython.fm and I want to add email to it. 
00:49 There is a great service called Pobox, pobox.com 
00:53 and you can come over to Pobox and you can for 35 dollars a year 
00:58 set up custom email routing, rules, spam filters, 
01:04 all sorts of stuff on top of your own custom domains. 
01:08 Now you can also pay a little bit more and set up an inbox there 
01:12 and do your email there entirely, but I think Gmail is one of the best 
01:16 email systems out there these days and so what I do is I just have all the email, 
01:20 with various rules redirecting to a host of Gmail aliases and addresses. 
01:27 So think about that, 35 bucks a year 
01:32 and you have high quality, properly implemented, 
01:35 no need to worry about it, you don't need to keep it running inbound email. 
01:40 I'll take you on a quick tour of my Pobox. 
01:43 So over here, just to show you the pricing for individuals, come down here, 
01:47 you can get the full mail system for 50 bucks, or this is what I have, Pobox Plus, 
01:51 all I care about forwarding, forwarding up to five different addresses,
01:55 use your own domain, and you even get an outbound SMTP server 
01:58 so I can send mail through basically outbound email 
02:03 and as a reply somebody writes me a message 
02:06 to contact@talkpython.fm, I can reply to them and it looks like 
02:10 it's coming from contact@talkpython.fm, but they don't really have a server. 
02:14 So that's the service I have, I am logged in over here, 
02:18 you can see I can add a variety of addresses so if I want to add address 
02:22 maybe I could do something like support@, these are my various domains, 
02:28 talkpython.fm, boom, I hit add and it will tell me which email address do you want to use, 
02:34 I could say let's use mikeyckennedy plus talkpythonsupport@gmail,
02:40 whatever you want, then I can do rules against this, in my Gmail, right. 
02:45 I am not going to click this and actually add this but that is how I would do it.
02:49 You can see I've got a bunch of senders, I've got spam filtering turned on, 
02:54 I can blackmail addresses so if some address starts getting spammed a ton
02:58 I can delete that address and tell it to like throw away those emails and so on. 
03:04 Basically you just have to set up your mail settings when you add a new domain,
03:08 so that's easy, they take you through it and so on. 
03:12 Over here you can see some stats, I'll just show you some numbers real quick, 
03:15 so apparently this is the email traffic that I had, right, 
03:18 this is how many emails I sent or received, so green is delivered, these are held, 
03:24 these are spam, I get quite a bit of spam because I publicly list my email address, 
03:27 so obviously it gets spammed like crazy,
03:30 but these guys are pretty good at dropping it and then I forward it to Gmail 
03:33 and they also get rid of the rest of the spam, nothing really bounce, 
03:36 maybe one bounce there- no, no bounce, it's all good, 
03:40 and these are the ones I've replied to, 
03:42 you can see over here it tells you like those are messages sent to other people 
03:46 through the SMTP server here, right,
03:48 that's me replying to people that sent me messages, over there. 
03:51 Pobox, it's beautiful, you don't have to do anything at all in your server, 
03:55 all you have to do is map your domains, MX records, the mail records, 
03:59 to the right settings here that they are going to give you, 
04:02 then you set up rules to forward it to where you really care to answer your emails, 
04:06 and like in my Gmail, I set up an alias for contact at talkpython.fm 
04:10 so I can even send outbound from Gmail as that and I can also automatically reply 
04:16 from that address if somebody sends it to me and so on.

00:00 Remember back when we created the register method? 
00:03 We added this little bit said hey when we figure out to send email, 
00:06 we are going to send an email here. 
00:08 So I want to go through two levels, I want to send a very basic email 
00:11 just to show that sending emails is working and then we want to come back 
00:14 and we want to look it away to send very nice, beautiful emails
00:17 like I showed you in the beginning of this chapter. 
00:20 OK, so we are going to come here, we want to go email service,
00:23 and let PyCharm import that, thank you PyCharm 
00:27 and we want to call send_welcome_email, 
00:31 and we are going to need to say who we are sending it to, 
00:33 remember, we don't actually get their name, we just have their email address, 
00:36 so we'll just send them an email say "hey you, welcome". 
00:39 Alright, so PyCharm can write this function for us, like so, 
00:44 and it defaults to a class method, I am cool with that, 
00:47 you can change it to static if you want or do something else, 
00:50 so what we are going to do is we are going to come up with the html_body, 
00:54 and it's just going to be standard HTML. 
00:57 So let's do something like this. 
01:06 OK, so here is a pretty cheesy HTML email that we are going to use, 
01:13 and let's just make this one, let's make this one strong 
01:16 so you can see some of the markdown stuff happening. 
01:19 We are going to send this email and the way we are going to do it
01:22 is we are just now going to call emails service, right? In email service, 
01:26 we want to call that basic send_mail and we have to give the "to" address, 
01:31 which is email, subject is going to be "Welcome to Blue Yellow Rockets", 
01:37 and the body is just going to be this html_body here. 
01:41 Right, that's all we got to do. 
01:43 Now we are going to get much more advanced about constructing interesting stuff, 
01:46 we are not going to write HTML like this much longer, but for a simple test, 
01:50 let's try this, we are going to run the site, and hopefully, 
01:54 there is a lot of moving parts here, hopefully we got it right, 
01:58 so let's go over here and log out, and we are going to go register, 
02:02 and I am going to try different account, I am going to do +blueyellow,
02:07 it's a trick you can do on any Gmail address, is put a plus wherever you want 
02:11 and it basically registers as a separate address,
02:14 use the same password, it's very fancy, it's called test, so let's go. 
02:19 Oh, it looks like it didn't quite work, so obviously, I forgot it was in dev mode, 
02:25 so that is not going to send anything, and up here in this "register" 
02:29 we forgot to do out cookie_auth, remember we did our cookie_auth in "sign in"
02:33 but we didn't do it here, but the account was created, I have to create another one. 
02:37 Let's store the fact right away, let's do it almost immediately. 
02:43 Store the cookie_auth, so here we are going to sign in, 
02:46 and we are going to send our welcome email, 
02:48 and let's just go over here and put this not in dev mode. 
02:52 OK, I've actually set it to be not in dev mode,
02:55 what I have in my real apps over here is, I'll print this out, 
02:59 so let's go and do it here we'll say print('Running in ...such and such mode.
03:08 We'll say dev, dev mode, else prod. Try again, OK, so now you can see 
03:18 we are running a product mode, because I changed that, 
03:22 let's register one more time, 
03:26 +blueyellow2 and back here for the sending,
03:30 alright, registered, we just sent one live message, great, 
03:36 now let's go checkout my email, you can see it took a second to do the email sending 
03:41 and then it redirected, it didn't crash, that is already a good sign 
03:45 so let me go check my email and see what I've got. 
03:47 Awesome, look what we've got here you guys, welcome to our site,
03:50 I can see we have some sort of misspelling here, "Thanks for registering with use", 
03:54 here is this, it should be "us", right? And I should probably put a new line in there, 
03:58 but that is not the point. 
04:00 Look we sent, let me zoom this back a little, here we go, 
04:05 we sent our email to us, HTML email via Amazon SES, 
04:10 it sent it to that address, how cool is that?

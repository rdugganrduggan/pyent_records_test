00:01 Alright, it's time to actually send this email instead of just print it out, 
00:04 let's say EmailService.send, we have these various things here, 
00:08 let's do send_password_reset. 
00:16 And what do we got to pass, we are going to need to pass the email, 
00:19 and the reset code. 
00:22 And we don't need to pass the whole thing, we can just pass the reset.id, 
00:25 so let's generate this method. 
00:31 OK, now it's going to be very similar to this one, 
00:34 so I'll just copy that really quickly, and instead of sending welcome 
00:39 we are going to send password_reset, reset password, which I have already done, 
00:43 it's got the email, I don't think we actually we need the email in that part of it, 
00:49 what we need is the rest code, let's just double check that really quick,
00:55 we need the reset code, so here this goes like this, 
00:59 and we have the rest.id, then we'll say... this is going to be "reset your password...", 
01:05 it's kind of a long title but we are going to go with it. 
01:11 OK, let's see what we get here. 
01:15 Let's go over here and generate yet another reset, 
01:19 this time it's a little because it's actually sending the email, 
01:22 you can see down here, "Sending message (live!)" and then boom, 
01:26 it says we would have send it, that's left over, we actually did send it, 
01:29 let me check my email, 
01:32 hey look what we found in our email. "Reset your password", 
01:35 and here you can see the URL, let me hover over this, 
01:39 shows you some great long code, reset password and I put local host, 
01:43 please don't really put local host in yours, 
01:45 but so I could do the demo without doing some kind of deployment, here we go,
01:48 so if I click this, it should take us back to our app with this "Reset your password". 
01:53 Now in the next video I am going to come back 
01:55 and actually use that code right there to validate and perform the reset. 
01:59 And that will wrap up everything to do with the password resets.

00:01 We learned the conceptual idea behind "git add" and "git commit".
00:03 Let's dive back into the command line, so we can test out the Git add command.
00:07 I am in the Python For Entrepreneurs course demos Git repository.
00:11 But there is nothing that's changed in this repository
00:13 so when I run the "git status" command it tells me that there is nothing to commit.
00:17 This repository contains all the source code for the entire course
00:20 and if you look at all the directories, you'll see the example code,
00:23 for each of the chapters, now this chapter on Git doesn't have any example code
00:27 but I am going to add some resources that I think are really useful
00:30 when you're getting started with Git.
00:32 I am going to create a new directory, this will be for chapter six,
00:37 we'll move in, and I am going to create a resources file.
00:43 We'll just add a single resource to this file for now,
00:47 that way we can test the "git add" command.
00:56 This is just a link to the Full Stack Python source control
00:59 page that has many resources, not only for Git
01:02 but for the general source control concept as well.
01:05 We'll save this file and then quit out and now when we type "git status",
01:08 we'll see that we have a single file that needs to be changed,
01:11 but it seems a little odd, it's not pointing to this specific file
01:14 that we just created resources.markdown, what Git is telling us
01:17 is that there is actually a new directory that has files within it that needs to be added,
01:21 I'll move up one directory, and now I'll explicitly specify
01:25 we want to add the Git resources directory.
01:28 When we type "git status", we'll see that there is a new file in a new directory
01:31 that needs to be committed to the repository.
01:34 We've set up the file for staging, what happens if we accidentally added this
01:37 to our staging area, that is where the "git reset" command comes in handy,
01:41 we can type "git reset HEAD" and now, we're back to where we were before,
01:45 there is a new directory, a new file, but they are not in the staging area.
01:49 We'll add this again and this time we'll use the period, which says
01:52 add every single change that is from this directory
01:55 and every subdirectory within this directory.
01:58 "git status" command, and now we're ready to commit this file
02:02 and the new directory, but we'll handle that in the next video.

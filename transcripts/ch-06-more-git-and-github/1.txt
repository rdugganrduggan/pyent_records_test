00:01 We got our first taste of Git and GitHub in the previous chapter,
00:03 and we have a little bunch of monotonous one-time setup where we installed Git,
00:07 signed up for GitHub and configured our account so that everything was connected.
00:10 With all that out of the way, we're going to get more hands on with Git in this chapter.
00:15 First, we're going to take a look at the Git commands,
00:18 git add, commit, status, push, pull, remote and a few others.
00:21 These are the basic building blocks of Git that allow us
00:24 to use it as a version control system.
00:26 Source control is critical even if you're working on your project by yourself,
00:29 if you're working with others, we're also going to cover
00:31 collaborating with other GitHub users, we'll add collaborators to our repository,
00:36 and take a look at how pull requests and issues work.
00:38 Learning about collaborating through GitHub will set us up great for later on,
00:42 in one of the chapters where we take a look
00:44 at working with other people on our businesses.
00:16 Most of our time in the videos in this chapter are going to be spent on the command line,
00:50 it's better to get comfortable with all the Git commands on the command line first,
00:53 because that's really where you're going to be working most of the time.
00:55 But we'll also take a look at graphical user interfaces, these GUIs are clients
00:59 that can make some confusing tasks easier by providing visuals
01:02 that make it easier to understand the outcome of the commands we're trying to run.
01:06 Those are the three primary objectives for this chapter.
01:09 I also recommend that you take some time each day to practice using Git
01:13 so you can build your muscle memory,
01:15 so the Git is a tool that boosts your productivity rather than getting in your way
01:17 whenever you are trying to get something accomplished.
01:19 Both Michael and I have been using Git for the last several years
01:22 and I can say with experience: When you use it regularly, the tool becomes second nature to you

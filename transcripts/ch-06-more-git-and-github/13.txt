00:00 We've gone through a lot in the past two chapters on Git and GitHub,
00:03 let's just take a few minutes to summarize what we went over at high level.
00:06 First we dug into Git commands, such as "git add",
00:09 to add modified files to a staging area,
00:12 "git commit", which actually commits them to the index for Git,
00:16 "git status", which allows us to see what's been modified since our last commit,
00:20 "git log", which shows us all the commits that we have done
00:23 throughout the entire history of our Git repository,
00:25 and "git push" and "git pull" to move files to and from local and remote repositories.
00:31 As I've said a few times throughout the course of these videos,
00:33 these are all the building blocks for using Git
00:35 and while you need to become comfortable with each one,
00:38 they really work together in combination, with Git in our tool belt,
00:41 we're able to use GitHub to collaborate with other users on our projects,
00:45 in some cases, this will just mean that people can file issues tickets
00:48 against bugs they found in your application.
00:51 Other times, you will actually be working with people on code,
00:53 where you will be pushing and pulling from the repository
00:56 and while git and GitHub can be overwhelming for non-developers,
00:58 you can also use GUI tools such as SourceTree to make it easier
01:02 to add and modify files that you're working on others with.
01:06 As I said at the start of this chapter, you really need to have daily practice
01:10 with each of these commands in order to build muscle memory.
01:12 Get in the good habit of making small commits at a time,
01:15 pushing them up to your repositories on GitHub and in general,
01:18 make it a part of your daily workflow as you're building your projects.
01:21 Now what do you do if you get stuck?
01:23 Well, here is some more resources to help,
01:25 there is a couple of pages that I work on constantly on Full Stack Python,
01:27 which are Source Control and Git, and this will provide many more
01:31 tutorials and resources and additional context for what these tools can do for you.
01:35 Now, if either of these pages, or any page on Full Stack Python
01:38 doesn't have what you're looking for, you can file an issue ticket
01:41 at the URL you see here. Whatever questions you have about using git and source control,
01:45 I'd love to be able to answer them on these pages
01:48 so that not only you can get the answer that you need,
01:50 but also anyone else who is reading Full Stack Python and of course,
01:53 you can ask questions on Twitter, either myself
01:56 @fullstackpython or Michael on @talkpython.
01:59 Git can take a while for you to wrap your head around what is happening,
02:02 but once you get comfortable with it, it's a really great safety net for your projects,
02:06 where you know that your code is not only backed up,
02:08 but you can also roll back to earlier versions in case you accidentally introduce bugs
02:12 or just need to see what changed. With that, let's keep working on our projects.

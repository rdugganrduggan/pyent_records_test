00:00 All these git commands can get a bit confusing,
00:02 so it's helpful to have a user interface through a desktop application
00:06 to help you manage all of your changes in Git.
00:09 In this video, we'll take a look at one of those desktop applications,
00:12 there are many of them out there but SourceTree,
00:15 which is made by Atlassian, is one of the best.
00:17 We'll download, install, and set up SourceTree with our GitHub account,
00:20 so we can get a little bit of extra help managing our git repositories.
00:23 The first step to get SourceTree is to get a sourcetreeapp.com and download it for Mac,
00:28 or whichever operating system that you are working on, once that's saved,
00:32 we can open it up, once it's extracted install it,
00:35 either by dropping it to applications or through the installer if you're on Windows.
00:41 Once it's installed, we can open it up, and if you get a confirmation, just click open,
00:46 now we do need to use an Atlasian account in order to log in here,
00:50 but we're going to connect this to GitHub instead.
00:53 So, if you don't have an Atlassian account, go to atllasian.com and sign up for one,
00:58 just  a free account, once you've got that in place,
01:01 we'll say "use an existing account" and we can log in, OK, now we're registered,
01:06 and we can set it up, click GitHub and we're going to use the OAuth authentication,
01:13 we'll connect our account, if you enabled too factor authentication,
01:17 you'll need to get the verification code, punch that in and you should be verified,
01:21 well to give it access to some of our account,
01:24 including both public and private repositories,
01:27 and we'll have it generate an SSH key for us.
01:32 Click "Copy to Clipboard", awesome, so now it's listing all the repositories
01:38 that we have got associated with our account, and this may take a few minutes,
01:43 once the list is populated, we can click on a specific repository,
01:47 and we can also search, so I'll search for "fullstackpython"
01:52 and we can specify where we want to clone that repository.
01:55 For now I'll just put this under my home directory.
01:58 Since I already have most of my repositories on my local system, instead of cloning one,
02:02 I am going to just add it based off of the files that are in my local file system,
02:06 now there is a few ways we could do this,
02:08 one way is just to drag and drop into the tool from the finder
02:12 or we can click "Scan a directory", alright, now I've added Full Stack Python,
02:17 this allows us to work with all of our Git history within a nice graphical user interface
02:22 instead of just using the command line.
02:24 To be honest, I don't really use GUI tools all that much,
02:27 I tend to stay right on the command line and you can do everything you need to do
02:30 on the command line, but especially when you're learning all these commands together,
02:34 it can be helpful to have this tool and essentially it's going to run the commands
02:37 behind the scenes for you. I won't go into all the features,
02:41 that SourceTree offers but I will show you that you can compare various commits
02:45 you can see what's changed, in each of those commits and just in general,
02:49 as you start to add commits to your project for your business,
02:52 there is a nice way to go through everything just in case you've introduced defects
02:55 and you need to fix them, go back and see what's changed, those sorts of tasks.
02:59 That is a real quick overview, of how you can sue GUI tools,
03:02 like SourceTree in order to manage and view
03:04 all the changes you're making to your projects through Git.

0:02 If you are using Linux, it's time to get your machines setup to take this course.
0:07 Let's see what's involved.
0:09 Here we are in Ubuntu, and you can see I have the PyCharm page pulled up,
0:13 so there is a couple of things we need to take this course,
0:16 we need Python 3, and we need PyCharm.
0:18 As we get it farther into the course,
0:21 you'll see that there is some packages we need, we are also going to need Git,
0:24 but let's save installing that until later, this is what you need to get started.
0:27 So, the first thing is to ask well, "do you have Python 3?"
0:31 Let's find out. If you just type python --version, you'll see that that's Python 2.
0:37 That's cool, in Ubuntu, you can type "python3" to run specifically Python 3
0:42 regardless of how your path is set up,
0:44 and let's see what do we get here. 3.5.2, that is the latest.
0:47 So, it looks like we already have Python set up, that's great,
0:51 and if you have 3.5.1 or 3.4 something,
0:55 that's fine, as long as it's basically a new version of 3.5, we'll be in good shape.
1:00 The other thing that we need to get is PyCharm
1:03 so over here at jetbrains.com/pycharm I've got the page pulled up
1:06 and you can see it says "download now",
1:09 and if we go to download it, there's actually two editions,
1:11 the professional edition and the community edition.
1:14 Well, which one should you pick, what's the difference?
1:16 If you go back to that first page, you can scroll down a little bit
1:19 and see there is a little comparison table here,
1:22 all the Python features about code inspections and auto complete,
1:26 things like that are exactly the same between the two editions,
1:28 for this class though, we are going to need a few extra things
1:31 that are not covered in the community edition,
1:34 because we are doing web development and we are working with databases,
1:38 you will definitely want to use those features
1:40 in addition to the Python web frameworks like Pyramid.
1:43 So, I strongly recommend you get the professional version,
1:47 there is a 30 day free trial, if you want to buy it it's not too expensive,
1:50 as an individual you can either pay $89
1:53 or if you want you can just pay $8.90 a month for a couple of months,
1:57 as you go through this course, I think it's totally worth it.
2:00 If for some reason you really don't want to use PyCharm,
2:02 you can get away with that, you can use Sublime text,
2:05 this is also a highly capable editor, as you'll see,
2:08 there are quite a few features that PyCharm brings that Sublime text does not.
2:14 Especially when you are newer, it will help you even more,
2:17 bur regardless of your experience level, I think PyCharm is a much better choice,
2:20 nonetheless, you may want to use Sublime Text
2:23 or Atom is also a great Python capable editor from GitHub.
2:28 So those are your choices for the editors.
2:30 Now, we've got Python, we downloaded it,
2:32 I actually already downloaded it because it's kind of large, so let's go and install this.
2:37 Over here, we are going to uncompress it, and we'll just extract it here,
2:41 so we want to take this folder and put it somewhere more useful,
2:44 I like to have this little bin folder over here, so we are going to move this over,
2:47 I mean the name in here is not the best so let's rename it,
2:50 like the version number rather, so rename this,
2:55 so we want to run this file, so if I double click it,
2:57 obviously it's just going to open up the editor,
3:00 so let's go back to our terminal here, and we can try to run it like so,
3:06 and it's going to go and launch, perfect.
3:08 Now, you may have to install the JDK, because PyCharm is based on IntelliJ,
3:13 which that platform is a Java based application,
3:16 so if you try this and you get a Java error, just install the JDK
3:19 by googling for whichever version it says that it needs and install that,
3:24 then you should be able to run this.
3:25 The other thing is, this is nice that it's over here but when I close it, it goes away.
3:30 So we can come over here and say lock that to the launcher,
3:33 that way when we close it, we don't have to have this thing open,
3:36 we can just re-launch it from here.
3:38 Great, so this Linux box this Ubuntu box is ready to take this course,
3:42 we have Python 3 installed, by default, and we have PyCharm set up
3:47 and ready to roll, so let's get to it.

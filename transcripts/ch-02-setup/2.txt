0:02 Hello my fellow OSX fans.
0:05 Let's talk about getting your machine setup so you are ready to take this course.
0:10 The first thing you are going to need to do is set up Python 3.
0:13 We can check to see whether Python 3 is installed,
0:16 first let's see what happens when we say Python--version.
0:20 OK, so we have Python 2.7 installed, that comes with the OS X, that's cool.
0:24 But if we ask for Python 3, which on OSX we can do by typing python3 like this,
0:30 you'll see no, there is no Python 3.
0:32 So, just download it and choose that, choose the 3.5.2
0:36 choose whatever the current version is when you get here.
0:39 Now, I already downloaded it so let's go and install it.
0:42 It just comes as a package, install package, so just next your way through it.
0:52 Excellent, it looks like it was installed just fine.
0:56 Now, let's try that again.
0:58 Excellent, we have Python 3.5.2 installed.
1:02 So Python is all set up, the other thing we are going to need is an editor.
1:05 And we already talked about using PyCharm as the editor for this course.
1:09 So, over here at jetbrains.com/pycharm we'll see, here is the PyCharm page,
1:13 and we can go and just download that,
1:15 there's actually a choice when you go to download,
1:17 do you want the professional or do you want the community edition.
1:20 Now, what's the difference?
1:22 Well, on the other page, if you scroll down farther,
1:24 you'll see that for the basic Python stuff, everything is the same, right,
1:28 the community and the pro edition.
1:30 Where they really differ, unfortunately for this class, is actually where it matters.
1:35 So, in addition to having the regular Python support,
1:39 it's all about web development, the web frameworks, database support,
1:44 things like that are only available in the pro edition,
1:47 but luckily there is a 30 day free trial.
1:49 And it's not too expensive, you can pay $8.90 a month
1:51 or you can pay $89 a year and it gets cheaper as it goes on and on.
1:56 So like I said, I've already downloaded PyCharm,
1:58 let's go ahead and mount it, it's a disc image,
2:00 and installing is pretty much draggy droppy, no problem, just wait for it to copy over.
2:06 And now it's all ready to go.
2:09 When it launches, it will ask you the first time what theme you want and so on,
2:14 I would choose, I like the dark theme
2:16 so I choose the Dracula theme for both the IDE theme and the layout or font colors.
2:22 You can pick whichever you want.
2:25 And there you go, PyCharm is ready to create a new project,
2:28 of course, we are saving that for a little bit later, but just to look ahead,
2:31 it's going to start right there.
2:34 If for some reason you really don't want to use PyCharm,
2:37 Sublime Text is a great option, it has support for Python, JavaScript, CSS,
2:43 not as good as PyCharm but still, not bad.
2:46 Another good recommendation is Atom,
2:49 if you want the more lightweight text editor, so you can download that,
2:53 and it's also free, this is from GitHub.
2:55 But like I said, we are going to be using PyCharm for most of the course,
2:59 and it really is more full-featured, more helpful,
3:03 more efficient than most of these.
3:05 All right, this Mac is ready to rock and roll and get going on this course.

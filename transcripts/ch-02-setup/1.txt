0:02 The first thing that you are going to need to take this course is Python.
0:07 We are going to be using Python 3 in this course.
0:10 You may or may not know there is bit of a divide
0:12 between an older version of Python called Python 2,
0:16 sometimes referred to as legacy Python,
0:18 and a newer version of Python 3.
0:21 But, the tide is basically turning and Python 3 is really
0:24 the best choice to start new projects today.
0:27 We are not going to go into too much detail about the differences,
0:30 we are just going to focus on Python 3 in this course.
0:33 You can download Python 3 from here if you don't have it
0:36 or if you are on Linux you can use things like aptitude to get it,
0:40 we are going to actually go into detail how to setup all of these tools on your machines,
0:44 but just know Python 3 is one thing that's going to be required.
0:48 The other is a great editor, and by far in my opinion
0:52 the best all around editor for building web applications in Python is PyCharm.
0:57 So we are going to talk about how you download and install PyCharm,
1:01 there is multiple versions, editions I guess you would call them,
1:05 and we'll talk about which one you are going to need and why to choose that and so on.
1:10 There are other choices if you don't want to use PyCharm, you don't absolutely have to,
1:13 you can work without it of course,
1:15 and we'll talk a little bit about that in the upcoming setup videos,
1:19 but let me just leave you at the one thing - why would you use PyCharm?
1:23 You are going to see throughout this class why this is absolutely the case,
1:26 but we are not there yet,
1:28 it's going to take a while to build up all the various moving parts,
1:30 they are like OK, this thing really is awesome,
1:33 so while ago, back in 2015 I wrote a blog post called
1:35 Nine Reasons You Should Be Using PyCharm
1:37 and you are welcome to check that out if you want to see just some of the benefits.

0:03 If you are using Windows, let's get it ready to build your business with Python.
0:08 So the first question you might want to ask is:
0:11 "Do I have Python on my Windows machine?"
0:14 And there is a very high probability the answer is no.
0:16 But let's just verify.
0:19 So we can start by just typing "python" and see what happens.
0:22 Nothing, there is no Python.
0:24 By default Windows does not include any form of Python,
0:27 which is unfortunate, but that's the case.
0:30 The first thing we have to do is download Python.
0:32 And over here at python.org we can choose the version 3, so Python 3
0:37 whatever the latest one of that is,
0:39 so I've actually already downloaded it, that's over here,
0:42 so we can go ahead and install that, it's super easy, just run the installer,
0:46 I would certainly advise you to add Python 3 to the PATH
0:50 and you probably want to customize this,
0:52 we don't really need it for all the users, but that's good.
0:57 What else do we want? Why don't we go and precompile the library
0:59 that might make it a little faster, associate the Python files if we want
1:03 and you'll notice that it's going to go into your user profile here
1:07 under the hidden AppData\Local folder,
1:10 so I prefer to have it a little more discoverable for me,
1:13 so I am going to say "this is going to be Python and it's going to come here."
1:17 So I can just come to my user profile and find it.
1:20 All right, let's go.
1:28 Great, Python was installed, now let's see if we have it up here.
1:32 We still don't have it and that might seem a little bizzare,
1:35 we added it to the PATH, we've installed it,
1:36 but these prompts read the PATH from the system
1:40 when they launch and they don't auto refresh.
1:42 So let's try again.
1:45 This time I'll just ask for the version. Python 3.5.2. Perfect.
1:49 So, Python is ready to roll on this machine.
1:51 The next thing we need to do is set up our editor.
1:54 We are going to use PyCharm.
1:56 We talked a little bit about why we are choosing it in the beginning,
2:00 but let's just go over here you can see if you hit download,
2:03 and this is at jetbrains.com/pycharm, there is actually two options here,
2:08 we can use the community version or the professional version,
2:12 if you go back to the original page, you'll see there is a "choose your edition" section
2:16 and it will show you what the differences are.
2:18 And so, the main Python features - version control, auto complete,
2:23 things like that are identical between the editors,
2:25 but, for this course you are going to need some of the pro features -
2:29 web development, Python web frameworks like Pyramid, as well as the database support.
2:33 So you want to make sure you get the pro edition,
2:36 it comes with the 30 day free trial and if you want to buy it, as an individual,
2:41 you can either get it for $89 a year or $8.90 for a month.
2:46 So, you could get just a month worth to try out this class,
2:49 if you are going to take more than 30 days to get it finished,
2:51 I really recommend that you use PyCharm, the pro version,
2:55 you'll see throughout the class why it's so much more powerful
2:58 than many of the other options.
3:00 That said, if you don't want to use PyCharm, you don't have to,
3:03 you could use something like Sublime Text, this is a great editor,
3:06 so you can get that at sublimetext.com
3:07 or Atom, at atom.io from GitHub, also a good, more lightweight editor.
3:13 So, I already downloaded PyCharm because it's little big,
3:16 and let's just run that, there is really not to much to do here
3:20 just got to decide how you want to either put it on your desktop
3:24 or associate with "py" files, things like that, and let it go.
3:30 And, let's go and run it.
3:34 When you first launch it, it will pop up this window
3:37 and ask you what hot keys you want and what theme,
3:40 if you are on Windows, you probably want the Visual Studio hot keys
3:43 and if you want it dark, a dark editor like mine, that's how I like my code,
3:46 then choose the Dracula theme,
3:49 otherwise you could probably just pick the default.
3:52 All right, now we have Python and we have PyCharm,
3:54 this Windows 10 machine is ready to build a Python-based business.

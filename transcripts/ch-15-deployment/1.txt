00:01 You've got your application built, and you're ready to go, ready to launch. 
00:04 But it needs to be hosted somewhere, we can't just run it off your local laptop;
00:08 that's where deploying web applications comes in. 
00:12 The deployment is a huge topic, the goal for this chapter 
00:15 is not to make you an expert in devops and deployments, 
00:18 but instead to have some practical experience 
00:21 getting your application shipped and allowing you 
00:24 to ship constantly, as you make improvements to your code. 
00:27 We'll keep this as simple as possible, each video 
00:29 is going to focus on one aspect of the deployment 
00:32 and just about everything is going to be hands on, 
00:35 at the command line, rather than a whole bunch of theory. 
00:37 Here's what we're going to cover: first off, 
00:39 you need a server somewhere that is going to host your application.
00:42 And we use a cloud service to do that, 
00:45 in this case, we're going to use Digital Ocean.
00:47 I've also used services like Linode in the past, 
00:50 and the idea here is we're just going to get a single server, 
00:52 and deploy our application on it, we're not going to use 
00:55 an infrastructure as a service provider like Amazon web services or Azure, 
00:58 we'll keep it simple, just have a single server that allows us plenty of scale,
01:01 and is more secure because it's only a single box 
01:04 that we're going to lock down against malicious actors. 
01:07 Once your infrastructure expands to multiple machines, 
01:10 there's more attack factors, so in this case we'll keep it simple, 
01:13 we'll keep it straightforward so that your application can be as secure as possible, 
01:17 without having to learn too much about web server security. 
01:20 Once we provision our server, we'll install an operating system,
01:24 we'll start to configure that operating system for a deployment user 
01:26 and make sure it's locked down and ready for the rest of deployment 
01:29 which will have a web server, and in the Python world 
01:32 what's known as a wsgi server, web server gateway interface, 
01:36 it is a standard interface between an application like the one that you built, 
01:40 and the server which is actually executing the code, that's a wsgi server,
01:44 it pretty much runs your web application, if you're in the Python ecosystem. 
01:48 We will get all that set up, along with the application dependencies, 
01:51 so whatever specific libraries and frameworks that you're using, 
01:54 for example Pyramid we'll be able to install those
01:57 on the server that's running the code, so your application will run
02:00 just like it does on your local machine. 
02:03 Throughout the deployment we're going to use Ansible, 
02:05 a configuration management tool that is built in Python 
02:08 to automate every step throughout this process. 
02:10 The first deployment that we do will be automated 
02:12 so that subsequent deployments can be done
02:15 with a single command from the command line. 
02:17 Ansible has some core concepts like playbooks and tasks 
02:20 that we'll review and then we're going to write all of our tasks 
02:23 within these Ansible playbooks and you'll be comfortable 
02:26 adding extra steps as your business grows and expands, 
02:28 and you want to change your application over time. 02:31 Let's dive into getting your application up and running.

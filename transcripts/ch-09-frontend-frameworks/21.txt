00:01 Now that you know Bootstrap, you know about Bootstrap themes, 
00:04 it's time to take a page that looks like this 
00:07 and turn it more into a page that looks like this. 
00:10 As you can imagine, we are going to use Bootstrap plus a Bootstrap theme 
00:13 to jumpstart our path from the left to the right. 
00:16 Let's begin with the theme. 
00:19 So over here, I am going to use the same theme
00:22 that I use on Talk Python To Me and Talk Python Training 
00:26 just so that you guys can see like this is the theme I used, right? 
00:30 You don't necessarily have to pick this theme 
00:32 as you've seen, there are many beautiful themes 
00:35 like this one is really wonderful and so on, 
00:37 but we are going to use this landing page theme, mostly because that's what I used. 
00:42 So, if you are really going to use this as your website, 
00:44 it probably makes sense you go fork it, on GitHub, 
00:47 just so you have a copy, that said, we are going to stop by just downloading it. 
00:51 Alright, let's just look in here and see what we've got. 
00:54 This is what came out and over here, now you can see we have this landing page. 
00:59 And if I cycle back and forth between our target here, 
01:02 you can see a lot of similarities like I dropped out this little HR, horizontal line, 
01:09 and moved the call to action buttons up and the little subtext or the H3, H2 
01:16 whatever that is, underneath there and so on, let's go down a little bit, 
01:20 to let's say this section here, something like that, 
01:23 you can see that that looks a lot like this, 
01:26 well, a little more like that side, actually no, this one. 
01:29 Those are quite similar obviously, different pictures, 
01:32 the background is not white but black, 
01:35 I kind of like this darker sites for certain things, 
01:38 notice that there is a distinction between this color 
01:43 and this color for these horizontal slices as they build up 
01:46 similarly over here you can see the horizontal slices 
01:49 are light gray, dark gray, light gray, dark gray. 
01:52 So what we are going to do is we are going to move that theme into this website, 
01:57 we are going to have it more or less just look like 
02:00 what the theme that we downloaded looks like, 
02:03 we are of course going to plug this into the master view,
02:06 the Chameleon templates and things like this. 
02:09 Then, we are going to take the various design elements I have in our final page 
02:12 and move those over. 
02:15 You will see over here on the desktop I've got a few images here 
02:18 that are being used in the page, we'll talk about where do we got those 
02:23 and how we are going to use them when we get to them, 
02:26 but we are going to bring that over, plus a little bit of our design and content, 
02:30 mix it together with the theme and we'll be off to the races.

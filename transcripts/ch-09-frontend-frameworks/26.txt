00:01 OK, let's see what's next.
00:03 Well, we've already added our get notified section,
00:05 now we want this upcoming events, 
00:07 and we of course want this to be responsive 
00:10 so if I make it smaller, we want the images to go like so, 
00:14 we want that to go underneath, we don't this to look too weird,
00:17 it is kind of weird that the image is so big just temporarily 
00:20 but we are going to use our Bootstrap grid again to do this. 
00:24 And if you look of course, these images that come from the original, 
00:28 are exactly responsive in the same way,
00:31 that is where most of this behavior is coming from. 
00:34 So again, let's come down here and we've got, here is our form, 
00:37 so let's rename this to newsletter or something like that, 
00:41 so that we can link to it, we are going to do this again, 
00:44 but now, we want to do things a little bit differently. 
00:49 Like I said, we are going to work with this "a, b" stuff in a better way 
00:53 but I'll just put "b" for the moment. Inside here instead of having this, 
00:56 we are going to have some different HTML and I am just going to paste it, 
00:59 like I said, not worth watching me type, I'll just copy. 
01:03 So what we are going to do is actually we want to get rid of that one, 
01:07 now what we want to do is we want to have a section that has that picture, 
01:11 so here is the picture of one of our live events to try to tell everyone, 
01:16 "OK, look how fun it is to come to our concert." 
01:18 Next to it in the responsive way we are going to have 
01:21 some really cool upcoming events, so if you are in North Kansas, Bottleneck, 
01:25 they've got awesome stuff, I'll be sure to stop there, Boulder, Colorado, 
01:29 Crystal Ballroom, Portland, lots of good places, so we are going to be, 
01:32 our band is going to be playing there, and we want to have this responsive layout, 
01:37 so notice, we've got this section here, that's just like a padding if you will,
01:41 there we've got 3 and a 5 and a 2 and if I did things right, 
01:46 adding those up add to 12 and it does, so remember, 
01:49 we need 12 columns to make up the whole grid 
01:53 and this will be 3 twelfths wide of screen 
01:57 and this will be 5 twelfths wide of the screen,
01:59 When you think of it as a ratio. 
02:01 We are going to need to add this image, I don't think it's here, no it's not,
02:06 so over here we've got our event, there it is, it looks like fun, right, 
02:09 I just can't wait for some stage diving to start to happen. 
02:13 Alright, so we'll put that over here, like this, great, 
02:18 and let's just look at our site again. 
02:22 so it should appear right under this newsletter 
02:24 and if i refresh it, look at that, beautiful,
02:37 you can even see the alternating style a, b, a, b, going. 
02:31 When we're done we'll have a darker color, 
02:33 but that is that, now let's check the responsiveness. 
02:36 There we go, responsive, just like we expected, really cool, huh? 
02:41 OK, so that section is done.

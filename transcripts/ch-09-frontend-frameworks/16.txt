00:04 So dialogues are relatively new to the web world, they are not new 
00:07 but compared to everything else, they are fairly new.
00:10 The primary benefit of working with dialogues is 
00:12 people don't need to leave your page, 
00:14 you don't obviously need to use nasty secondary pop up windows, which was never great. 
00:19 Let's look at an example and how I've used dialogues on my training website, 
00:23 so here I am in an incognito window, so not logged in, 
00:27 on one of the course listing pages, and it happens to be this course, 
00:30 you can see the URL at the bottom if you want to try this yourself.
00:33 If you click on one of these lectures, and you are not logged in... 
00:36 It's important that's you're not logged in for this to work, 
00:39 it will pop up a dialogue that says "hey look, 
00:41 you are not signed in and you don't own this course,
00:43 so I am not really going to let you watch the video, because I spend a lot of time on this, 
00:47 I've got to pay the bills, or go do something else, 
00:50 and I don't want to go do something else, so help support the course by paying for it."
00:53 Well, here I am using this dialogue in Bootstrap to pop up two very quick options,
00:59 they could either sign in, if for some they weren't signed in 
01:03 and they just didn't realize "oh, if I sign in then I get to my course", 
01:06 or you can click that button and it will go to Stripe 
01:08 and do a credit card purchase right there, we'll get to that section later. 
01:13 If neither of those two options make sense, 
01:15 maybe you are not sure what this course is about, 
01:17 you want to see whether maybe you want to buy it maybe you don't, 
01:20 I put a little description in a video at the bottom 
01:23 where you can watch something very much like this video itself
01:26 to help convince people you know, give them a little bit of proof 
01:29 that these videos and these courses are not crummy 
01:32 but actually pretty decent quality. 
01:34 You'll see that adding this functionality to our web application is super easy with Bootstrap.

00:01 Now let's look at one final thing before we leave our example here. 
00:04 Notice this is light across the top, and if you look up here, 
00:07 you can see that I have a propensity for dark navigation across the top. 
00:11 Not, always, one of my podcasts is all about the white 
00:14 but I kind of like this dark style when I am doing developer type stuff,
00:18 I know this is like a podcast where developers come,
00:21 we all like dark themes - not all of us, many of us like dark themes,
00:24 so how do we do that?
00:25 Well, it turns out to be super easy. 
00:27 If we come over here, we can say instead of navbar-default, 
00:31 we can have navbar-inverse, now if I just do that, and refresh this page, 
00:36 now you can see we have a nice dark version and everything inverses itself. 
00:41 It's really great, but notice there is something weird going on,
00:44 and this makes no sense to me why Bootstrap does this, but they do it.
00:48 Look, really carefully here, zoom your eyes up here into the corner. 
00:53 Notice? Rounded edges, like what the heck? Why would rounded edges be here?
00:57 I think they just kind of overdid it on the rounded edges when it comes to navigation. 
01:02 Like it just doesn't make any sense to me, 
01:04 it seems like it should be a bar across the top. 
01:05 Never mind, we can fix that really easily. 
01:11 So up here, we can see .navbar has border-radius like that, 
01:17 let's copy this, and here is the way I like, 
01:20 any time I'm overriding a Bootstrap theme, 
01:22 instead of sticking this into my main site, 
01:24 what I would do is I would have a style sheet like this, 
01:29 I always put this right after Bootstrap. 
01:33 I can call it something like bootstrap-overrides.
01:37 So, any time you want to change the default behavior of Bootstrap, put it there
01:41 if it's not specifically about your site,
01:42 so you kind of know like what themes of what things am I doing 
01:46 specifically to sort of be part of or counteract what Bootstrap is doing. 
01:51 So let's put this here and we want of course "0",
01:54 now we are going to need to include that 
02:04 so bootstrap-overrides. Thank you, PyCharm. 
02:06 Now if I go back over here, refresh, 
02:09 so much better, you can see down here somewhere,
02:13 this is the border radius that came from Bootstrap 
02:16 but the bootstrap-overrides said "no, no, no, no - stand back, 
02:20 we're putting zero here" and if you look carefully again,
02:23 now it looks more like you might expect.

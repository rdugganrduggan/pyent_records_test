00:01 Now that we have the site kind of fitting with our old site and the new site 
00:04 like our navigation works more or less like we'd want and so on, 
00:08 it's time to start adding our copy and our content,
00:11 let's begin with this huge image right here, 
00:14 like this image is pretty decent but we can do better. 
00:17 So, we are going to take this image here, many of the images 
00:20 you are going to see me use here are images I've gotten from Flickr, 
00:24 under creative commons commercially allowed uses, 
00:29 so I'll be sure to link to those somewhere in the site or something to give credit, 
00:32 that's the requirement for using them, but I am going to put them here. 
00:35 Another great place to go is Death To The Stock Photos 
00:38 if you want free images or you know, for a real site, like for my sites,
00:42 I paid a couple of dollars, like ten dollars for my images,
00:45 and it makes all the difference to have a great image. 
00:48 So we want to take this and move it into our site, over here, 
00:51 we already have our hero, great, so the next thing to do is go to the landing page 
00:55 and find this section and change this, I don't think it's that one, 
01:01 change this one, to hero.jpg and notice down here 
01:09 there is another mistake, so let's actually put this on there as well. 
01:15 I think one image we weren't seeing, we'll see in the moment, 
01:18 OK, let's go refresh again, oh we've lost our image, 
01:22 of course, because it's not on the theme, it's right there. 
01:26 Alright, beautiful. Check this out, isn't that cool? 
01:29 Here we have our hero, our guys rocking on on stage 
01:32 like I already want to listen to the music that they are playing,
01:35 and of course, we are going to need to change this, this, change this links, 
01:39 that's all easy to do, let's go to the bottom really quick, 
01:41 oh yeah, this little plant image was messed up in the CSS, so it didn't show up. 
01:46 OK, great, now, let's flip back over to what we were looking for, 
01:50 here we have this and if you look, notice, this is a little shorter, 
01:54 than over there, so we can look at that really quick. 
01:59 Here you can see that we've set the height to be slightly different and so on, 
02:03 so let me go ahead and just take this, 
02:06 and we'll move this over, to our home, remember, 
02:09 we can start using our home now, this is only going to appear on the homepage 
02:13 so let's see if that works, I want to double check that that's actually a jumbotron 
02:19 alright, let's see how well I did, there we go.
02:21 Now you can't quite see if I scroll just a little bit though, 
02:24 ooh this is not quite the thing, hold on, 
02:28 that I think was supposed to be the jumbotron, here we go, 
02:31 so you can see it's not quite as huge, we need to move the stuff up 
02:34 and of course we will be doing that as we go, right, it doesn't have to be perfect, 
02:37 you get the idea of how to do it, that's the main takeaway here. 
02:40 So next, let's focus on these bits here, 
02:44 so I am going to be copying some of this stuff 
02:47 out of our existing or sort of final target site, 
02:50 there is no sense in you guys watching me write this copy, right, 
02:54 so for example, this top thing up here like this, we can just use that. 
03:04 OK, so I've copied this bit over and I changed the layout 
03:07 just slightly for what we have going on here, 
03:12 so let me just give you the quick summary because like I said, 
03:15 it's not worth you watching me create all the copy for the entire site here. 
03:19 There is a lot of stuff that was going on in the theme 
03:22 and I just simplified this down to this jumbotron 
03:25 and then this message that is contained within it, 
03:27 but it uses exactly the same settings for like the cover image and so on. 
03:31 So, here we have an H1 and then I put a paragraph that has the two buttons 
03:35 and these are just Bootstrap buttons - button, primary, large, 
03:39 one goes for out albums and one is going to go
03:42 when we have them to our upcoming events.
03:45 Then after that we had our little subtitle
03:47 "For those about to rock, we invoke you" 
03:49 and of course those need colors as well. 
03:52 So here you can see we are setting the yellow color for the subtitle. 
03:57 Alright, so I think this top part is in good shape, even our little navigation works, 
04:02 how about that, so I feel like we've come a long way already, 
04:05 now let's scroll down, now we're getting two pieces 
04:08 that maybe this main content that we need to work with. 
04:12 So our hero image and our main H1, H2 section 
04:16 with our call to action buttons is done, 
04:19 now it's time to focus on the rest of this homepage.

00:01 So let's jump right into code and see modals in action. 
00:05 I'm over here at getbootstrap.com in the modals section. 
00:09 So we can scroll down here and see some examples. 
00:12 So, here is this simple static example, here is a little dialogue, 
00:15 the styles are not over done on it, 
00:18 it's really kind of unstyled but it has a title at the top, 
00:21 it has as much content as you want to put in the body 
00:24 and then at the bottom it has a footer with the "close" and "save changes".
00:28 And in order to do that, we've got to put a couple of things together here, 
00:31 we've got to put this section, this modal dialogue, with the fade option, 
00:36 role dialogue and then here we can see 
00:38 we have the header and you can put whatever you want there, 
00:40 you have the body, alright, this is just standard HTML that fits into the container, 
00:44 whatever size that is and then at the bottom, we've got our two buttons, 
00:48 one has the data-dismiss modal and one is just standard button 
00:52 that we could hook some kind of event, submit a form, whatever. 
00:56 The other thing that we're going to need to do to show the dialogue 
00:58 is we're going to actually have to trigger it. 
01:02 Now here we have a button, but this just as well could be a hyperlink, 
01:05 which will then trigger that. It's possible that almost anything can trigger it, 
01:09 certainly buttons and hyperlinks even if they are styled as buttons, 
01:13 will do it and the reason it will do it is it says data-toggle="modal"
01:18 and so that's going to toggle the modal, 
01:20 and then the specific dialogue it's going to target, this is a CSS selector #myModal 
01:26 so id myModal, which is right here. 
01:29 So these two things are linked together by that CSS selector by the id. 
01:33 Let's look at this in action. 
01:35 Well, first of all, we can click it here, and it comes up looking like so.
01:39 Alright, let's look at it in our code. 
01:42 So over here, I've got something very similar to what you just saw, 
01:45 in fact, the id may look really familiar. 
01:48 So here we have a button, and it has some kind of "buy now" button, 
01:51 and suppose for whatever reason that makes sense for us,
01:54 that showing the dialogue with the details to buy a thing 
01:57 rather than leaving the page is what makes sense for us. 
02:00 And so we've implemented that dialogue down here, 
02:03 notice, it is still within the body, and just like you saw before, 
02:08 we've given it the right id, modal fades will fade in instead of just appear, 
02:13 and there is a role="dialogue". 
02:17 And then we have the various pieces, the header, the contents, and the bottom. 
02:20 Over here, we can click on this, and see what happens, 
02:24 so here is our "buy now" hyperlink, click it, 
02:27 and because it's got that toggle... that data toggle modal thing, 
02:32 it's going to click and show this particular dialogue, 
02:36 and now notice, this one doesn't close, 
02:38 this button doesn't have the data-dismiss, but this one does, right. 
02:42 The same is with this little x up here and in fact if you click 
02:45 anywhere outside, it also closes the dialogue. 
02:49 It's worth noting it doesn't actually destroy it, so if there was some contents in there, 
02:52 like if over here we had some kind of input like here, and I click away, 
03:01 and I click back, that input is still there, so in case you accidentally close it,
03:04 it's not like everything is lost, it will reappear the way it appeared before. 
03:09 So that's how these modal dialogues work, they are very easy to work with.
03:12 Just there is a lot of pieces, there is a lot of nesting here, 
03:15 you've got modal, modal dialogue, modal content, modal header etc, 
03:19 so just be really careful to not mess up what goes where, right, 
03:25 so you want to balance your HTML tags, don't leave an unclosed div or paragraph 
03:30 or whatever, because that's going to mess up the dialogue 
03:34 and it can cause all sorts of weird problems like one example I had messed up, 
03:37 I missed some kind of closed tag and the dialogue would show 
03:41 but it would never go away.
03:43 Or it would show and it there were like cycle showing over and over, it was very bizarre. 
03:46 So as long as you're careful about and make sure you close everything 
03:49 and it's well-formed HTML, you are in good shape.

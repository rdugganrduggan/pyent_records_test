00:01 We have our upcoming events all done, let's see what the next section is. 
00:04 OK, so here is upcoming events, OK, the next one is this cool section 
00:07 with the three band members, here in the middle. 
00:10 And, we are going to use again, like you imagine, one of these horizontal slices 
00:14 with grid layouts, so that some kind of responsive design happens, 
00:18 that's a little insane, but responsive design for the three band members there, 
00:23 of course, we could set max sizes on these images 
00:26 and that would prevent it from getting too crazy. 
00:29 So let's duplicate this section, like so, and we are going to switch it, 
00:35 like I said, we are going to automate that part later, 
00:38 we want to change this to "band"  
00:42 and in here we are going to put something very similar, not the same, but similar, 
00:45 where we've got our title that's going to be at the top 
00:50 and then we have some medium rows, 
00:52 maybe we want to make those small, I think we could do better with that, 
00:55 those pictures being huge, and of course it's not an "sd" but it's something with an "m", 
01:01 alright, so here we're just going to put our little header at the top, 
01:04 maybe that should be an H3, let's try that, 
01:08 we don't want to fight with defining what is important on the page here, 
01:13 so we are going to have H3 and then again, 
01:16 have a little bit of padding on the left and right, so like basically 25% left, 25% right 
01:22 and then we'll have three, one sixth worth of images for these guys. 
01:28 Now, this is going to look a little funky, it's not going to layout just right, 
01:31 but let's see how far we've come with this, there is the band members, 
01:36 and, well, I've got to say, I am not impressed with the way Rags is looking, 
01:38 he is not rocking it out, that's because we didn't move his pictures, so let's do that, 
01:42 go over to the members, there they are, we are going to move their images over, 
01:48 we'll make a folder for the members, and in there we'll put those three guys. 
01:55 How about now? 
01:57 There we go, that looks great, right?  
01:59 Notice some of the Bootstrap things we are doing here, we are doing an image, responsive, 
02:05 we already talked about that, we are also applying the circle style 
02:08 because if you look at the original images, they are square, but of course here, 
02:12 they have got that cool circle look, and I just love the way this 
02:15 sort of spotlights on them and it looks really good. 
02:18 The last thing that we need to do is put that in the center of the page, so let's give this, 
02:22 we have this band, so we say .band and go to our home and down here, 
02:27 we can say .band, text align center, like so, if we try again, there we go, 
02:34 that's great and just for now, I am going to put that back to H2. 
02:40 Alright, I think that looks pretty good, want to check the responsiveness? 
02:43 You know it's going to work, right? 
02:46 OK, so go like this, scroll down, there is the band members, 
02:50 they are kind of huge, but they get smaller. 
02:53 Now, notice this is a little small, let's do one more thing for the band members 
02:58 for their names, we'll say it's a block display, that's a little bit bigger fonts, 
03:02 we'll give it some margin, because right now it's kind of crowding up against that, 
03:07 let's run it and see how it looks. There we go, that's better. 
03:10 Dave Wilson, Mark Spencer, and so on. 
03:14 Make it bigger, unwrap, I think the band members are good 
03:20 and this section is looking done to me.

00:01 It's all these shiny features of Bootstrap that catch your eye when you first get started. 
00:06 The typography, the images, the buttons and so on, 
00:10 but the grid, the grid plays a super important role in helping design websites, 
00:15 especially from our responsive perspective. 
00:18 But also from an SEO perspective. 
00:21 So here is the training website, the Talk Python Training website, 
00:24 at least what it looks like at the time of this recording, 
00:27 and notice, we've got our big hero image, we've got a get notified section, 
00:31 and then we have three courses that are featured, 
00:34 and those courses of course are going to change over time 
00:37 but these are the three featured courses. 
00:40 What happens if this window shrinks, 
00:42 if it gets smaller than the width of those three images? 
00:45 Well, a lot of sites is just going to create like a scroll bar, 
00:48 and then that will actually force the design of the rest of the page
00:51 to fit that virtual size that that scroll bar would have, 
00:54 but luckily, I use the grid layout in Bootstrap to design this, so that doesn't happen. 
00:59 Here is what does happen. 
01:01 When you shrink this down to sort of phone size, 
01:05 it doesn't look quite as good like the Talk Python Training 
01:07 overlaps on some of the little images in the background, 
01:11 that kind of stuff is really hard to deal with, but look at the apps, 
01:14 see that Python Jumpstart By Building Ten Apps, it's now on top 
01:17 of the Write Pythonic Code, which is on top of the Python for Entrepreneurs part. 
01:22 That's because I designed that into a grid and said 
01:25 I want you to be kind of like a table, 
01:27 as long as the screen is desktop size, but once it gets too small to fit those images,
01:32 switch into a vertical layout, basically turn the table pieces 
01:37 or the table columns I guess you call them, 
01:39 into what would be line breaks and separate rows. 
01:43 This is the kind of layout that's very easy to achieve with the grid, 
01:46 we don't have to worry about trying to use sort of invisible tables, 
01:51 that's not great for SEO unless you actually have tabular data then tables are fine, 
01:56 but a lot of time people traditionally had used tables for layout, which is not a good deal. 
02:01 You could try it with divs and floats and so on.
02:04 but that is also really hard to get it just right and especially as the site changes, 
02:09 you'll see Bootstrap has a solid and understandable and predictable solution for this.

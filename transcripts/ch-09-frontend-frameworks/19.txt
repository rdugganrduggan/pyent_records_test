00:02 So you now know about Bootstrap. 
00:05 But there is one last step to go from bad to decent to amazing. 
00:10 So far we've gone from bad to decent, using the basics of Bootstrap. 
00:16 So here let's call this bad one number one. 
00:18 Number two, this is our basic page with Bootstrap, we could now improve this of course,
00:24 with our dialogues and out buttons and things like that, 
00:26 but still, this design is not going to win too many users. 
00:31 We need to really let our page shine. 
00:34 So what we are going to do to make that happen is 
00:36 we are going to take our knowledge of Bootstrap, our knowledge of HTML and put it together with themes. 
00:41 So, we could start with this thing on the left 
00:44 with basic CSS in Bootstrap we get to middle, 
00:48 and then with the Bootstrap theme, we get something super compelling 
00:51 and modern looking here on the right. 
00:54 One of the wonderful things about themes and Bootstrap themes in particular is 
00:58 there are many to choose from, so you'll see you get a lot of choice 
01:01 on how your page looks
01:03 then you can mix in a few images you get from a graphic artist
01:06 or from some sort of stock photography,
01:08 put your own copy in there and you are ready to roll.

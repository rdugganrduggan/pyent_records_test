00:03 So let's take a quick survey of frontend frameworks. 
00:06 We said that we are using Bootstrap for this course, 
00:09 and Bootstrap is by far the most popular and widely used one.
00:14 But Bootstrap is just one among many frontend CSS design frameworks. 
00:20 Here is Bootstrap, this site that you are looking at right now,
00:23 I just grabbed one off the internet, this one is designed and built in Bootstrap.
00:28 Now, at the top I put the number of GitHub stars for each project
00:33 so you can see relatively how popular it is and then the link to get it at the bottom,
00:37 so you can see that Bootstrap has little over a 100 thousand GitHub stars 
00:41 that is some serious love it's getting, 
00:44 The second most popular framework is Semantic UI.
00:50 And you can see it's quite popular as well, 30 thousand GitHub stars 
00:53 and its main claim to fame is that it's very simple and easy to work with
00:57 as well as it integrates with many third party libraries 
01:00 so it's easy to bring lots of stuff together. 
01:03 Foundation is a lovely looking framework, 
01:06 and it sells itself as an enterprise-grade responsive frontend framework
01:11 And so, you can check it out, it's got 24 thousand GitHub stars, 
01:14 all of these are extremely popular, it's just sort of dwarf by Bootstrap, right. 
01:19 So this one is really popular, really well done. 
01:22 Materialize is cool if you like the Google Material design 
01:26 and you want to bring that design into your web application, 
01:29 you can use Materialize. 
01:31 Again, 21 thousand stars, Gaggle Mail, this is not the website for Materialize, 
01:36 but it is actually a website built with Materialize, 
01:39 and personally I think this looks fantastic, right, 
01:42 this is a really good looking way to build your website and like I said, 
01:46 if you want to make it look consistent with Google's Material design, this is really great. 
01:51 And there are many, many more such frontend frameworks. 
01:54 This article here, you can see the URL at the bottom, 
01:57 it is the top ten frontend frameworks of 2016, and of course, 
02:01 all the frameworks I just showed you are listed there, but there are another six or so. 
02:06 So you can look around there, what's cool about this article is 
02:09 it says here are the pros of this frontend framework, 
02:12 here are the drawbacks of this frontend framework, 
02:14 and what makes it special, where you can find it, where you can learn more. 
02:17 So, if you are not yet decided what you want to use, check out this article, this is cool. 
02:22 I'm here to tell you that Bootstrap is by far the most popular, 
02:25 and that has important knock on effects, so it's not just well, 
02:30 other people know how to use it or you can find answers on Stack Overflow, 
02:33 but when you get to the themes, it's much easier to find the Bootstrap theme 
02:37 that looks great that you can use, it's not expensive or has the right licensing,
02:42 a Semantic theme right, just popularity helps there.

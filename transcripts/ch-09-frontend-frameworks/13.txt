00:02 Any web app worth interacting with must have 
00:06 not just HTML forms for user input, but beautiful and engaging ones. 
00:11 Too often they look more like this,
00:15 here is a registration page that has a few icons and so that's kind of cool, 
00:19 but other than the few icons, it really looks terrible, 
00:23 it has not much of a style, these are more or less the default styles 
00:26 that come with your web browser. 
00:29 However, with just a little bit of work, we can make this look much better. 
00:34 The one on the right is enticing and you know on the other side of that 
00:38 "create an account" page is some kind of really cool and engaging application. 
00:43 The one on the left, this is probably more like something put up on your intranet 
00:48 that you have to deal with that you dread every time you have to go to it, 
00:51 and half the time it doesn't even work. 
00:53 Having these forms that look nice and are engaging is really important 
00:57 and you'll see the Bootstrap has a couple of options for this, 
01:01 Bootstrap has a couple of classes that we can use, 
01:04 that make the basics of having really nice input forms easy. 
01:08 Now it just so happens that this registration page here on the right
01:12 comes from this place called codepen 
01:14 and someone there was nice enough to actually create this in a form that we can play with.
01:19 So if you go over here, you'll see that you can actually play with the CSS and the HTML 
01:23 and you can come over here and change it however you want. 
01:28 Now it says "registration dialogue". 
01:29 So if you like this form and you want to play with it, 
01:32 hey, here is something to start with; 
01:34 we are going to go back and focus on the simpler form 
01:37 just building out the ability to create a blog post 
01:41 and make this form that starts out looking really bad look...
01:45 you now, not amazing but pretty decent, just a few key Bootstrap classes.

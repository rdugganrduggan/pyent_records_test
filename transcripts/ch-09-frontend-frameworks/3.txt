00:02 Do you remember that scary page from the web design section?
00:05 It looked like this, it was just plain basic HTML, zero styling. 
00:09 My contention was that most of you were like 
00:12 "oh my gosh, I don't even know where to start when looking at something like this" 
00:15 to try to make it look like AirBnB or something beautiful. 
00:19 If we just take Bootstrap and drop it into there,
00:22 you'll see it already is going to look quite a bit better. 
00:24 So it will look like this. 
00:26 Now, the title slightly changed but other than that it's identical, 
00:29 other than just including the Bootstrap CSS, 
00:32 but notice how much more pleasant it is to look at. 
00:35 How much nicer the words are in terms of reading. 
00:39 The line height changed just a little bit, the fonts and spacing,
00:43 the spacing between the letters, the spacing between the lines, all of that, 
00:47 the typography is much cleaner, the headings look better, 
00:51 the colors are adjusted a little bit. 
00:53 Bootstrap, just by including it, will take any page and make it look a little bit better, 
00:59 but we want to go a lot farther than that,  remember, this is our goal, 
01:02 this is the landing page or homepage of our Blue / Yellow Rocket Band. 
01:07 Now, let's just do a quick tour to point out some various pieces 
01:12 that we are going to see on our tour of Bootstrap. 
01:14 So we have this navbar across the top, that comes from Bootstrap, 
01:18 you can't see it because I am not resizing the screenshot, 
01:20 but if I did, you would see that that is a responsive design 
01:23 that turns into a slightly different version on mobile than it does on wide desktop screens. 
01:27 We have nice looking call to action buttons, 
01:30 albums, upcoming events and "get notified", 
01:33 we have this big banner, this hero image to call out to people coming to our page
01:38 to just let them know "boom, here is the band", 
01:41 like you are on stage with them here, 
01:44 and this is part of one the themes that we are going to bring in, 
01:48 you can see the form about getting notified looks pretty nice, 
01:52 that comes from Bootstrap, both the button as well as the form and the way it behaves,
01:57 from some of the form controls in Bootstrap 
02:00 and the image and the upcoming event below the up above picture of the band there, 
02:06 that's actually in the grid layout so that image itself is responsive 
02:12 so it changes based on the size that it has to work with, 
02:15 as well as those two components, they don't just crush themselves together,
02:19 they fall one on top of the other when it gets too skinny like on mobile as well. 
02:23 So all of this is going to come from the Bootstrap grid layout and image classes. 
02:28 So with that in mind, let's go take a quick tour of Bootstrap. 
02:32 Now, you may be tempted to pull up bootstrap.com, that's not Bootstrap; 
02:36 getbootstrap.com, that's where Bootstrap lives, just remember, 
02:41 there is some sort of the weird site just at bootstrap.com.
02:44 So here we are at getbootstrap.com, 
02:47 notice there is a notification a Bootstrap 4 is coming pretty soon,
02:50 so it's not released yet, I believe there is few breaking changes 
02:54 so just be aware when that comes out;
02:55 but here is what we want to look at; we want to look at Bootstrap 
02:58 and it's broken into a couple of sections, we can download the zip file and solve it that way,
03:03 I am actually recommending the way to do this as via Bower or npm, 
03:07 take your pick there, something that can auto update and manage that for us. 
03:10 So let me just click on getting started, and it talks about how you download,
03:14 I talked about you can just download the Bootstrap source, 
03:17 it comes with Saas, so kind of a higher level than CSS design language there, 
03:22 you can use the CDN, that's what you get from the startup projects in Pyramid 
03:26 or you can install with Bower, just "bower install bootstrap" 
03:29 or maybe a better option is to use bootstrap-CSS 
03:34 and that will give you a smaller version. 
03:37 You could also install with npm if you don't want to use Bower. 
03:40 Let's look at a few examples. 
03:42 So over here, this gives us a quick idea of what we have to work with.
03:47 You can flip through and you see there is a bunch of options, 
03:50 of all the various things you can do, here is a nice little Cover thing, 
03:53 here is a Carousel, and so on, let's just focus on this one real quick. 
03:58 So here you can see we have the nice let's call it "well", this thing 
04:01 that says "theme example" at the top, you can see the navigation, 
04:05 the navigation is a little dropdown and if I change the size 
04:08 it should even become responsive and it does, like this, very nice. 
04:11 All that is automatic. 
04:14 There is some nice buttons, different sizes, and colors and so on, tables. 
04:19 You don't think too much about styling tables these days 
04:22 because people shy away from them, but when you have tabular data - guess what, 
04:25 a table is pretty sweet and they have nice easy designs for it, we've got thumbnails, 
04:29 these labels here, badges, dropdowns, all kinds of stuff,
04:34 cool progress bars, and so on. 
04:37 So next, let's go back to the Bootstrap site, 
04:41 they could work on their layout there a little bit couldn't they? 
04:44 Let's look at CSS, the design elements you have to work with 
04:47 are broken into a couple of categories, you've got CSS, 
04:50 which are the core CSS elements, 
04:52 and you've got components and then things that require JavaScript to work, 
04:56 so that goes at the end, these are broken up into different pieces, 
05:00 and we can check them out. 
05:02 So there is a couple of things to notice over here, 
05:04 that Bootstrap is HTML 5-friendly, it's mobile first, I talked about typography, 
05:09 I haven't talked about normalize.css but normalize is really important. 
05:14 One of the pains of web design is 
05:17 when on different browsers the same HTML CSS looks different, 
05:22 and often that difference arises from the browser having no explicit style for a thing 
05:27 and then making their assumption about how that should look 
05:31 and if say Firefox has a different assumption about how H1 should look 
05:35 compared to say Chrome, then that's going to look a little bit different. 
05:39 Normalize explicitly sets every single possible style 
05:42 so those types of challenges basically don't exist. 
05:46 So when you include Bootstrap, you get one of these reset or normalization.css files 
05:51 which is great, we are going to talk about the grid system 
05:54 and how you can use that to achieve tabular type layout that is also responsive, 
06:00 it's not just tables jammed in there, we talked about typography, 
06:03 tables have really nice ways to style them, 
06:06 let's see if we can pull up one, like this is a pretty good looking table, table-striped, 
06:10 here you can see the alternating styles, it's a little subtle, so a little bit harder to see, 
06:15 so all you've got to do is throw it on there 
06:16 and your table looks much better automatically striped. 
06:19 You can see that forms look much better in here, 
06:22 so we can use like form control elements, we are going to get into that, buttons, 
06:26 we have some nice looking buttons and colored call to action 
06:30 sort of primary color buttons, very nice. 
06:34 We are going to spend a dedicated section on that as well as on images, 
06:37 you can see what different image shapes that we have to work with, 
06:40 as well as responsiveness. 
06:42 Speaking of responsive, Bootstrap comes with a number of 
06:45 responsive design helper classes. So for example, 
06:49 if you've got certain page elements that should only show up on large screens 
06:52 and you want a different representation or a small one, 
06:55 you can combine these settings to basically hide those. 
06:59 I use this often in navigation, less so outside of there.
07:03 Now, let's look at the components, 
07:05 there is a few interesting elements in the components, we have these Glyphicons,
07:09 these are OK, Font Awesome is way better, 
07:11 and so I'll be using Font Awesome for our stuff, but it kind of plays the same role. 
07:15 The idea is to use a font for little icons rather than pictures 
07:18 because you can perfectly resize them by changing the font size 
07:22 and change the color by just changing the color for an element, 
07:25 which is very hard to do with images.
07:28 So you can sort of style these icons better if they are fonts than if they are fixed images. 
07:32 The most important take from this section we are going to work with is navigation, 
07:35 so you'll see little warnings as well like 
07:39 warning, this requires the JavaScript to be available 
07:42 which requires jQuery and the JavaScript file for Bootstrap. 
07:45 So you can have little tabs, like this, these are nice, 
07:48 or you can have these things called Pills, over here,
07:51 or more likely, what we are interested in is the navbar, 
07:55 down here, so something like this, make it wider, 
07:59 it should look all different, here we go we have this nice little dropdown here and links, 
08:03 stuff that sticks to the right, stuff that sticks to the left, 
08:05 we have forms, like search boxes, all kinds of stuff. 
08:08 And we can even change this to be a dark version or a light version, 
08:13 depending on whether we put the nav inverse or nav default. 
08:20 Last over in the JavaScript area you'll find some cool things as well, 
08:23 for example, Modal dialogues are really great 
08:26 or Scrollspies also, super cool. 
08:29 Let's look at Modal real quick; so if we had some kind of link, 
08:33 we are going to click and have something that looks like this come up, 
08:36 and put whatever HTML in the middle we like that's great, 
08:39 of course we can style it here 
08:40 we can launch a Modal dialogue and it kind of pops in, 
08:43 and whatever you want to put in here you can have 
08:45 and you can close it back out and so on.
08:47 So, we want to make use of that in our design, for sure. 
08:50 The other thing that's cool down here is Scrollspy, 
08:52 so the idea is you've got these various sections on your page that relate to navigation, 
08:57 and as you scroll, you kind of move into these other areas, 
09:00 and you'd like the navigation at the top to be stuck sort of to track as you move,
09:06 so if you are kind of doing a more of a one page design, 
09:09 you still want navigation, this Scrollspy is cool. 
09:12 Alright, so that's a really quick fly over of Bootstrap.

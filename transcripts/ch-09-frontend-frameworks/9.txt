00:03 Users spend a significant part of their time interacting with your navigation bar. 
00:08 It tells them what the site is about, what are their options, 
00:11 where can they go, what can they explore, 
00:13 it's super important to have a good navbar. 
00:16 Here you can see the one from Blue / Yellow Rockets Band, 
00:18 we'll put this design together in just a little bit. 
00:21 It's also important that this navbar adapt to various screen sizes. 
00:26 So this is great on a desktop, but what if it's small, 
00:29 we'd like it to collapse into what is often referred to as a "hamburger menu" 
00:33 so these three little lines and that square box are rounded square box. 
00:37 And when we click that box, would like to see it expand out 
00:41 and show us the same navigation or very similar navigation here. 
00:45 You'll see that Bootstrap gives us all of this for free, basically.

00:02 As we've seen, beautiful forms are key to user engagement and happiness. 
00:06 And, you just want your app to look beautiful and entice people to interact with it. 
00:11 So we've seen that those forms on the left can easily be transformed 
00:15 to the forms on the right, using just a couple of CSS statements 
00:20 and some Bootstrap CSS classes. 
00:23 Remember, we've added form-control to the inputs and text areas, 
00:27 button to the button, 
00:30 and we added a little margin to input some text areas. 
00:33 Let's look at the code. Here you can see we have our inputs, 
00:37 we've added the placeholders so we don't have to deal with 
00:40 having a title or a label and the important thing is we've added form-control. 
00:44 This makes the input display or layout in what's called block style, 
00:48 that means each input is on its own new line, 
00:51 that's why we don't need a "br" or some sort of line break,
00:54 but it also makes them wide and sort of full screen 
00:57 as we talked about to look best on mobile devices and small screens. 
01:01 So we threw this input and text areas style to say let's set the max width to 350 
01:05 and we also thought they were a little cramped, so let's put a margin on it. 
01:09 And that's how we got that really nice-looking form 
01:12 out of basically raw HTML with Bootstrap.

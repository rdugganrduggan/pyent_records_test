00:01 I think we've done it, I think we've built the page, 
00:03 we've adapted the landing page into our site the way we want it, 
00:06 if we look through, you can see we've got our great little banner 
00:09 we've got this "get notified", we've got upcoming events, we've got band members, 
00:14 and "book us", and we've got even our cool little footer. 
00:17 There is two final things I'd like to talk about here, 
00:20 one is I want to get this become dark like the rest of the site, 
00:25 so let's see how we can do that. It may be easy. 
00:28 If we go over to our site, here you can see the color is black, 
00:32 let's set the color to be white, in fact, white is not the best color,
00:35 you maybe want just a shade off of white little less, 
00:39 and let's set this; black also is not the best option, 
00:42 so I really like when I am doing the dark theme, 222 it's not that different 
00:47 from the PyCharm editor actually, if you want of course you can come over here 
00:51 and pull this up in an editor and say look I want a really bright version of this, 
00:55 and I want this green and it will pop it in there but I am just going to go with that, 
00:59 now, let's just see what effect this has, it's not going to be perfect 
01:02 but it will definitely darken some things. 
01:07 Here you can see it's darken the few of them but we have these alternate ones, 
01:10 why is that this color, let's find out.
01:13 It turns out, when you're on one of these section "a", 
01:16 the section "a" has a color- and that's our alternating color, 
01:24 so here we'll go like this and instead of having that dark, let's set it to like 333. 
01:33 Now how does that look? 
01:36 The color, I like the colors pretty well, maybe it's a shade light, not entirely sure, 
01:40 but I don't really like the bars, these are supposed to be borders in the previous examples,
01:46 let's look and see where are they coming from. 
01:56 OK, on section "b", you can see there is these borders, 
01:59 let's go ahead and take these over here and have a thought about them. 
02:03 Alright, what do we want to do? 
02:06 See how I copied it straight out of Firefox, that's beautiful, 
02:09 so the padding is OK, maybe we want to tighten that up a little bit, 
02:14 this one not so much, let's set that to "none", and similarly down here, 
02:20 OK, that's pretty good, it may make sense to have a border, right, 
02:23 if we really wanted a border, we could do something like this to 1px solid #111 
02:32 and then there will be this little border here, 
02:34 but I don't think it's necessary given the contrast that we already have 
02:38 between the two levels, right, this is a pretty good contrast going on here. 
02:41 Alright, so there you can see we've got this whole page more or less 
02:47 looking like what we wanted it, and I know this section, 
02:52 this demo section here at the end of this chapter is kind of long, 
02:55 but we went from like zero to a really pretty good-looking website, 
03:00 I could get behind having this be my website if I was this band 
03:04 or if this was somehow representing my business, 
03:07 I think we could actually do better, 
03:09 but it's certainly not bad, and we did that by grabbing the theme. 
03:13 Really great, I am pretty happy with where we've come from, 
03:19 hopefully you feel inspired to be able to go grab one of these themes, 
03:23 apply it to whatever it is you are building and make it awesome. 
03:26 We have one more thing to come back 
03:29 and look at before we are done with this chapter.

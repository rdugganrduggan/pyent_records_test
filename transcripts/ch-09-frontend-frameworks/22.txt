00:01 Here we are back in PyCharm. And this is our master layout page. 
00:04 What we want to do is we want to bring in the common elements, files actually, 
00:09 from that landing page theme that we were just working with. 
00:13 So over here, we have our CSS, we are going to be using Font Awesome. 
00:18 Now, I believe I already installed Font Awesome here, yes I did, using Bower 
00:22 so I am not going to use their copy of Font Awesome. 
00:25 Remember, Bower lets us track for updates and automatically update and things like that, 
00:29 they have some fonts, this actually comes from Bootstrap itself, 
00:33 so we are not going to need to do anything for that, we have some images, 
00:36 we are going to bring those over initially, 
00:39 and then we are going to throw them away because I don't think we are going to use any of their images. 
00:42 We are going to use index.html to basically build our master page
00:47 as well as our home/index.pt file, we'll take the common look and feel, 
00:53 we'll put it in the master, we'll take the inner bits 
00:56 that are just the landing page, we'll put that into index.pt. 
01:00 And then of course we have the JavaScript. 
01:02 This JavaScript is just the Bootstrap stuff as well. 
01:05 So, let's just start deleting stuff until we get  it down to what we actually need, 
01:10 so here is CSS, we don't need that, in fact all we need is this landing CSS 
01:14 and this index.html, and the images. 
01:18 So that's really nice. Let's go over here to our CSS 
01:21 and we'll just put the landing page in here, I can copy from finder into PyCharm, 
01:26 that's pretty sweet, so we got this, 
01:29 and we are going to need to include that of course, 
01:31 so let's go up here and we'll include that right at the top up here. 
01:38 So there is our landing page and don't forget to update it over here, 
01:42 or otherwise that little cache stuff will no longer work, 
01:45 we are not going to change that page much, but nonetheless. 
01:49 You don't want to get caught with the stale CSS,
01:51 so we have this, and we are going to need our images, 
01:54 and now I am going to make a folder just so we know like what to keep clean
01:57 so I'll call this "theme", remember, we are going to mostly throw these away,
02:01 but I'll put them here for now because we want to get the site looking like the theme, 
02:05 and then like what we are looking for, OK, so I'll put these over here, 
02:09 of course, we are going to have to patch up the HTML, 
02:12 speaking of HTML, let's go and look at that. So we can come here, 
02:16 we can see, depending on your experience with HTML how easy it is to go
02:20 OK this matters, this doesn't matter, 
02:22 all of this stuff we already have all of that here, 
02:25 so if you look, here you can see we have all those things, all the title, the author, 
02:30 let's change that and I suppose I don't really care for taking credit 
02:34 but I don't want really to give credit to someone else, that would be weird, 
02:37 so let's just start deleting, I think maybe it's not the safest 
02:40 but it's the clear so landing page is out, we have Bootstrap, 
02:44 the order matters, so Bootstrap first, let's double check we are doing that up here, 
02:48 we are of course, we were already, so there is Bootstrap, 
02:51 we're going to go back here and see what else we've got, now look,
02:56 they are including this Google APIs font, so there is a cool place I think it's 
03:01 fonts.google.com, yeah, and Google has a bunch of great fonts that you can use, 
03:08 you can include them into your web page and so on 
03:11 but they come down in many different formats and varieties 
03:14 and it's easiest just to link directly into them and that's what this theme is doing, 
03:19 I don't know where the fonts appear on this page but we are going to put this, 
03:25 and you can see they're also doing the fonts from Font Awesome.
03:30 Let's make sure those both get in here
03:32 but we are going to have to of course change Font Awesome a little bit. 
03:35 So we'll go over here like this, organize it, so we can keep track, 
03:38 now we are not going to go to relative Font Awesome 
03:41 in fact, we are going to go to /static/, this is easier, bower, font-awesome
03:51 we'll just copy the path and then we'll have to fix it 
03:54 because it's going to have my full path,
03:56 we'll go back here and it's top of the static that we're looking for, 
04:00 alright, so there is our Font Awesome, 
04:03 and we've got the Google fonts here in HTTPS, 
04:06 sometimes you'll see this written like that, 
04:09 which means use whatever scheme to access the fonts that you have here 
04:14 so on a basic HTTP go to HTTP Google, 
04:18 if you are in encrypted page will do HTTPS, we'll just leave it though. 
04:22 Alright, I think we have the CSS integrated. 
04:25 Let's go back and we'll just keep chipping away at this sucker
04:28 until it looks like the way we want, so that's done, 
04:30 we already have this working, so the head is done, 
04:34 we again have the English language set and HTML 5 DOCTYPE, 
04:39 now they have a navigation bar over there let's go and just take this, 
04:43 and we'll fix that up, so down here we have our little navbar but remember, 
04:48 this is not the Bootstrap one, this is just a cheesy one I threw in here, 
04:51 we did our Bootstrap one in a separate file 
04:55 so let me just keep this here for just a minute so we can copy the pieces 
04:58 that we are going to need for our links, OK, 
05:01 so we'll come up here, all this stuff is just about the little collapse responsive design, 
05:06 so we can forget about that, this is really what we're after, 
05:09 we need some "lis" with some references in them, 
05:17 OK, I have moved those pieces around so we have exactly what we had 
05:22 in the previous page other than I drop the full long home path there. 
05:26 Let's look at our target to see where we're going 
05:29 so we can have it look more like that. 
05:31 So we have albums, "book us", and let me just actually copy the path here, 
05:36 so we have home, let's forget this for a minute. 
05:40 OK, great, so now we have what we are aiming for in the final design here,
05:45 now notice, I think "book us" is not going to work. 
05:48 So now you can see I have basically the navigational items 
05:51 that we are aiming for in the final one, right, 
05:55 we don't have to get this perfect, we're just going to get it mostly working 
05:58 and I think "book us" might not work yet, I'm not sure. 
06:01 We can at least get the structure the, navigation in place. 
06:04 So, let's go up here and see how we're doing, so far so good. 
06:07 Now if we go down here, this part is "about", this is the landing page, 
06:13 this is actually the title, this is the content of the homepage. 
06:17 So let me start collapsing stuff because 
06:19 we don't want that in our general layout, right, 
06:22 the general layout is for all the site, not for the homepage, 
06:24 we are just going to start collapsing these little sections until we get to a section, 
06:28 this one, we want to make sure we have the footer,
06:31 at the end, so let's take this footer and bring it out, 
06:34 and notice we have jQuery and Bootstrap, but I think we have that already,
06:38 so now we go down past our navigation, here is the main content, 
06:41 the stuff we left in index.html it's going to go here but not in this page,
06:45 it's going to go into index.pt. 
06:48 Now, after that of course, we are going to have a footer. 
06:51 A proper HTML 5 footer that is, and for now I am going to leave it 
06:55 looking like things look here. 
06:58 OK, we have jQuery, we have Bootstrap, 
07:01 and we even have a spot for our additional stuff when we want it. 
07:04 So I think things are OK, we are going to be missing a few images, 
07:08 but we don't have any content yet. 
07:11 Let's go and run this and just see how things work, OK? 
07:14 I'll just change the title while we are at it up here, 
07:15 this is going to be the Blue / Yellow Rockets, I think I had spelled it like this, 
07:21 are you guys ready to see what happens? Let's go.
07:25 I'll put it over into Firefox. 
07:28 Well, we're getting somewhere, we got a few things that we need to work on, right? 
07:33 That doesn't look great, we do have these elements up here
07:37 and we did actually set their color to be black or something, 
07:40 so now we are going to need to start working on this page. 
07:45 This is kind of how it goes, you know like oh that looks sort of like something, 
07:48 but not so much, so first thing we don't want a default light navbar, 
07:54 we want an inverse, navbar-inverse, so we refresh this, 
07:59 that's closer, let's look over here, 
08:04 I like for the navbars to be extra dark and so we can keep them in place,
08:09 so they stay in place, and they kind of stand out over the various colors of black, 
08:13 so we can go and work on that, but what you've seen so far 
08:17 is how to bring this template into our page, let's go ahead and do one more piece, 
08:22 let's go ahead and finish bringing in the main content, 
08:25 here you can see we've got something there, 
08:27 there is a bit of a top bar being stuck in a weird way there 
08:31 like there is this overlap and we can easily solve that, 
08:34 but let's just finish bringing in the main elements of the page, 
08:37 so this is everything that goes into the shared layout. 
08:41 We are going to need to of course redo the footer text and so on, it's not quite right, 
08:45 but, everything else that you saw here, from there upward, 
08:51 all of that is only specific to the home page, it's not specific to the entire site 
08:58 so where does that go? Let's close this stuff, actually, I am going to need this again in a minute,
09:02 that goes in home/index, right, that's our homepage. 
09:05 And so what goes there is this, and just for a minute, 
09:09 I am going to do a couple of "brs", just so we can see it because remember, 
09:12 that the navbar is over top, we'll fix this but let's drop it like this. 
09:15 Now, here, I am sure there are many images that are not working, 
09:19 for example, here, let's go and fix that, 
09:23 so this is going to be /static/image/theme, like that.
09:29 Let's double check, static/image/theme OK, cool.
09:35 And let me fix these over here, there is a few more, the dog, of course, 
09:40 the dog is good but the dog is there; 
09:43 the phones are good, but the phone's over here. 
09:45 OK, everything looks good. 
09:47 Now, it looks like this is going to work, but what may be the most important feature 
09:51 is actually missing, let's reload this and see what we got. 
09:54 OK, well, there is the landing page, and alright, look at this!
09:58 It's coming along very well actually. 
10:01 Remember that cool big landing thing right here, with a little pencil, 
10:04 the guy and the pencil being creative or something, glasses mean creative, 
10:08 we're missing that and where does that come from?
10:10 Well, it turns out that over in the CSS, it's actually referring to the file right there. 
10:16 So just like all the other files, we need to appoint to where it goes.
10:20 Now, it should be in good shape, ta-da, there we go, beautiful. 
10:24 Now there is some weirdness about the body having padding and stuff, 
10:28 because we're mixing our old design to the new design. 
10:31 What I am going to do next is we are going to go through 
10:34 and try to make this look a little better, we need to do some work up here 
10:37 and we need to do some work on the padding and whatnot. 
10:40 You can see how we've taken this theme from, this time we started with Start Bootstrap
10:46 of course, I said if you want a premium one, they have premium ones here, 
10:49 they have great premium ones at Wrap Bootstrap as well, we talked about that,
10:52 we've taken this one and in just a few minutes we've migrated into our site
10:57 and our site looks sort of like we wanted.
11:00 Obviously, we want to use different pictures, 
11:03 we want to have different horizontal slices, but the actual hard work is done, 
11:08 the hard work that remains, is not web design, the hard work that remains 
11:13 is actually selecting the pictures, writing the copy that is really compelling, 
11:18 what is the story you've got, you know, 30 seconds or 15 seconds 
11:22 to tell everybody what you are about, how do you do that, that's where the hard part is. 
11:26 But, you know, that's up to your business, you will have to that yourself, 
11:29 we'll go and move all the other pieces and sort of make this our design 
11:33 by copying over our goal into this site, in the next video.

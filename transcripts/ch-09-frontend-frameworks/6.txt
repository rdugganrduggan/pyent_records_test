00:03 Here you see a grid of gray squares, so what do these gray squares mean?
00:08 Well, they are supposed to have content but I decided to make just squares 
00:11 so you could very clearly see the grid actually come out of the page, 
00:15 imagine there is text, or there is pictures, or something much more complicated 
00:20 like some hierarchy of a thing, containing a div, 
00:23 containing an image and whatnot. 
00:25 We have different CSS classes on the screen here, 
00:28 you see I have column md, so md stands for medium, 
00:33 down here we have some column lg, that stands for large. 
00:36 And down here we have small. What do those mean? 
00:39 Well, medium means I would like this grid to retain its grid capabilities, 
00:46 or continue to look like a table on medium screens and above. 
00:51 That means I would like you to remain like a grid, on small screens, and above. 
00:56 But if it gets smaller than what small is defined to be, 
01:00 we'll see that later when we get to the concept, if it gets smaller than that, 
01:03 then I want you to break and turn it to like vertical stacked set of rows. 
01:08 So, this section here, this should last and retain its grid shape for quite a while, 
01:15 these right here will retain their grid shape until maybe about 
01:20 if I shrink it about to this bar, much more than it will probably wrap it, 
01:24 it will break down its table form, same with this.
01:27 We could also control how much of a percentage of the grid things take up. 
01:32 For whatever reason they use twelve elements, so here you can see
01:36 we have twelve column large ones, this adds a twelve, this adds a twelve, 
01:42 and you basically get then ratio of the screen for each segment that you define. 
01:48 So are you ready to see it in action?  Let's see what happens when I resize this. 
01:51 Alright, so if I get bigger, nothing happens and it gets smaller, 
01:54 pretty soon the bottom one will break first, 
01:57 because I said I only wanted to have this grid layout on very large screens, 
02:02 but any moment now, it's going to break, there you go, now these, 
02:06 all of the sudden become wrapped on top of each other. 
02:10 But the small ones and the medium ones, 
02:12 they still retain their grid form because they are supposed to be grid-like longer, 
02:16 on smaller screens, let's say. 
02:18 So, now the medium ones are going to break, and there they go, 
02:22 and you can see the small ones are still there, but eventually, 
02:25 if I make it skinny enough to small ones, themselves break as well. 
02:29 And, it turns into basically a bunch of vertical slices. 
02:33 And as we put it back, things start to reappear and then eventually, 
02:37 we can get our grid layout back. 
02:39 So it's really easy to put stuff into these grid cells, as we'll see, 
02:42 but this is how these various pieces work, 
02:45 we also have extra small, there might also be an extra large, 
02:48 we'll see when we get to the concept, all the various CSS classes, 
02:51 the exact pixel size, and what that means and so on.
02:55 Let's look at the code to make this work. 
02:57 So for all the demos in this CSS section, 
03:00 except for the final bit where we design the whole front page, 
03:03 I've created this bootstrap-example-snipped folder and put a bunch of straight HTML, 
03:07 we have one image we are working with, 
03:10 and we are just using Bootstrap straight off the CDN. 
03:13 So these are basically empty HTML pages 
03:16 except for the fact that they have Bootstrap 
03:20 and then we put this grid stuff or various things like buttons 
03:23 and the other ones, or dialogues and so on. 
03:26 And you also don't need PyCharm to open them, 
03:28 you can just double click them and view them right off the file system most likely. 
03:31 Alright, so here you can see we have the grid pieces, 
03:34 you can see these same CSS classes, 
03:37 notice I put that as text and as the class so it's really clear what is going on there. 
03:41 Now it always goes like this, we have some section that is called a container, 
03:46 and it contains a number of rows, 
03:49 so here you can see a row, here is a row, here is a row, 
03:52 and within each row, you can break it up into 12 segments; 
03:57 in this case, we've broken it up into 12 segments two ways, 
04:01 we said we'd like this first one to take eight twelfths, or two thirds, 
04:05 and this one to take four twelfths, so one third. 
04:09 Because we said medium, we wanted to retain its grid style 
04:13 or its tabular behavior on screens larger, medium or larger basically. 
04:18 Here we said let's break it up into three pieces of equal size, four, four, four, 
04:23 again, that's twelve, and here, we are breaking up into two pieces, six and six, 
04:28 but we want them to remain grid like, longer, 
04:31 even on small but not extra small screens. 
04:35 And then, at the bottom, we have our twelve cell piece, 
04:39 pieces of one but they fall apart very quickly when the screen gets small 
04:45 because this only works on large and above screens. 
04:48 It's easy to get this grid stuff somewhat complicated 
04:53 and I feel like people will sometimes make it more complicated than it needs to be, 
04:57 for example, you can have offsets and polls, 
05:00 and all sorts of funky stuff going on with these cells, 
05:04 like, I could have just the second one here but I could tell 
05:09 that it's offset by three cells and so on. 
05:13 But the simple form what you see on the screen here 
05:16 and which is pretty much good enough all of the time 
05:19 if you want to just keep it simple, 
05:21 the simple form here is pretty easy to understand 
05:24 and it's super helpful to design your website using the grid system from Bootstrap 
05:29 and it's even more important these days, 
05:32 I haven't mentioned this yet but Google ranks your page higher 
05:36 if it's mobile-friendly for mobile searches. 
05:39 So if somebody is on their phone, or their tablet, and they search, 
05:43 if you have a responsive website, there is a better chance 
05:47 that your website will be listed higher for those search results. 
05:50 And with the grid, it's really easy to do, so be sure to check that,
05:54 you can actually look at the Google Webmaster Tools tools, 
05:57 you can sign up for those, register your site with them 
06:01 and see whether or not Google thinks your site is responsive and mobile-friendly.

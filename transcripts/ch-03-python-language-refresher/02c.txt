0:01 Before I close out this lightning review on refresher of Python,
0:03 I want to point out that there is an appendix at the very end
0:06 covering many concept reviews.
0:09 There is about 45 more minutes down here at the end,
0:12 covering the language concepts point by point,
0:15 so if you need to understand "if" statements better, there is a short video on that,
0:18 if you need to work with loops, there is a video on that;
0:21 define classes, you guessed it, a video on that.
0:23 So we are going to move on to building web apps with Pyramid,
0:26 but if you feel like you need a little bit more, go and jump to the end,
0:29 check out the language concepts on the part that are little shaky
0:32 and then come back to chapter 4 and move on.
0:35 If you are ready to jump in to web development, you don't have to do anything,
0:38 you are going to be taken right there when this video finishes.
0:40 Let's get started.

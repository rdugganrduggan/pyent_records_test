00:01 Now, often people ask me about whether they should form a company, 
00:08 some kind of company really early in this process, 
00:11 and sometimes they will ask me what type of company that should be, 
00:15 should it be an LLC, should it be an S corp what should it be. 
00:18 I would say until you have actually put something out there, 
00:21 until you actually have a thing you want to publish, 
00:24 it's probably not really worth creating a company, I mean, 
00:27 I guess you could be considering getting funding before you launch, 
00:30 in which case, have a company, you could be considering patenting something
00:34 probably worth having a company, things like that, 
00:37 but neither of those are probably the most common case 
00:40 and so until you are ready to launch something I wouldn't really worry about it, 
00:43 but these things don't happen in one day, or right away, 
00:47 it could be a few days to get this finalized,
00:50 so don't wait until the day before you are ready to launch 
00:52 with all the final loose ends and the excitement of actually doing a launch to 
00:56 wait through this paperwork, but it's not something you got to start with for sure.
01:00 So the two primary business structures in the US are 
01:03 what are called a Limited Liability Company versus a Corporation. 
01:07 Now, according to Wikipedia, in US this is the private limited company, 
01:12 this is a company that designs basically pass through taxation 
01:17 with the limited liability of a corporation, so what does that mean? 
01:21 First of all, let me say I am not a lawyer, nothing in this course is legal advice, 
01:26 but I do have an LLC and here is my understanding. 
01:29 With LLC the income from this business, especially if it's a sole proprietorship 
01:33 is basically treated as just consulting income, or self employment income. 
01:39 Whether you make ten dollars, ten thousand dollars, or ten million dollars, 
01:44 it's taxed as if you just personally had a salary of ten million dollars, 
01:49 with the side caveat that you have a little bit extra, well, 
01:53 you have extra tax to pay through self employment tax. 
01:57 So, when you are getting into this, if you are making 
02:00 a significant amount of money through here, 
02:02 be sure to get an accountant and talk to them and get a consultation about taxes. 
02:05 LLCs are easy to set up, they have less reporting, they have less formality to them, 
02:11 as far as income goes, it's just like you earned income that your business had, 
02:15 and you can get a partnership which would mean like you say 
02:18 you have three people they each have a third, 
02:21 you would just receive one third of the income 
02:24 and you would have to disclaim that minus expenses on your tax report. 
02:28 This is quite common, you might think that this is only for dinky little companies 
02:34 not major companies like real companies don't operate as LLCs 
02:41 only like little mom-and-pop dry cleaner type shops do, right, 
02:45 in fact there is some really large companies like Fidellity,
02:49 The trading and investment company is in LLC, Enterprise, 
02:53 Albertsons, the large United States especially in the West Coast, very large grocery store, 
03:02 one of the largest grocery stores on the West Coast in the US is an LLC. 
03:06 So these can be very large, or they can be very small. 
03:09 The opposite of an LLC would be a corporation, and S corp, right, 
03:15 so this is more about how you treat the income and taxation 
03:20 than it is about the protection, because done correctly, 
03:24 the LLC should give you the same amount of protection as the corporation. 
03:27 But here you can set it up so that you don't get taxed twice, 
03:31 the corporation pays taxes and the shareholders 
03:35 also don't have to pay the exact same taxes, 
03:37 so the accounting is much more complicated there is some prescribed ways 
03:42 in which you have to operate 
03:45 and over site that you have to set up, thing like that, 
03:48 but S corp is also a very common option. 
03:51 You can transition from one to the other, I know that it's possible, 
03:55 I've never tried to do it, I don't know how hard it is to do, and I don't know, 
03:59 to me it just doesn't seem like a huge deal which one of these passes to go down, 
04:04 right, either there is a good chance that your business is going to have a hard time taking off,
04:08 because most businesses do, unfortunately, 
04:11 so then the structure doesn't really matter that much, and if it does take off, 
04:14 you'll have lots of money and lots of interest on getting this done just right, 
04:19 but do set up some kind of legal protection 
04:22 because you don't want something you do to come back and bite you personally 
04:26 with your house, with your family, anything like that.

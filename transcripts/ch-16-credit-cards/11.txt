00:02 So you are thinking, well that's cool Michael, 
00:05 LLCs, S corps, US corporations, none of that applies to me 
00:09 because I live in the country X, where X is not in the United States. 
00:13 Now obviously many countries have similar corporate structures 
00:18 and similar types of protections. 
00:21 You might just want to choose whatever is local for you.
00:24 There are sometimes, especially if you are looking to get venture capital 
00:28 and participate in some of the US markets that you might want to have 
00:32 a company that is set up and registered in the United States, 
00:35 with a US bank account that can accept credit card payments and things like that. 
00:40 That can be really challenging to get done if you live in some country, 
00:44 especially if you don't have good connections to the US, 
00:48 so Stripe again, Stripe the same people we are using for the credit cards 
00:51 came up with this thing called Atlas, and the idea is once you get into the Atlas program. 
00:57 they will help you set up and incorporate a US company set up a US bank account 
01:01 and accept payments as if you were a US company. 
01:06 So if you are outside of the US, but you want for whatever reason to be 
01:10 within the US as a business, check out stripe.com/atlas.

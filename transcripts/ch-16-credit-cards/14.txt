00:02 So let me leave you with the Story of Stratechery. 
00:06 Stratechery is a blog, which then became also this sort of 
00:10 follow-oner podcast called Exponent. 
00:14 And it's done by a guy named Ben Thompson and his co-host James. 
00:18 Really great, one of my favorite podcasts to listen to, 
00:22 I am always super excited when it comes out, 
00:24 they don't always get a hold of the topics I want, 
00:27 sometimes they are kind of rambly, but most of the time they are really good, 
00:30 and this particular episode, 34 of the Story of Stratechery is something 
00:35 that really should be studied by people that are building businesses, like us. 
00:39 They are not building necessarily the next Facebook, 
00:42 but maybe the next business that is going to give you freedom 
00:47 to build what you want and sort of grow, OK. 
00:49 So this guy Ben started this thing called Stratechery a few years ago, and what is it, 
00:55 it was a blog for business analyses of the tech industry,
01:00 so this thing that Microsoft just did was that a good move, was that a bad move; 
01:05 this thing that Apple is doing, how does that compete against what Amazon is doing? 
01:09 And so on, so he does a lot of writing like this, 
01:12 and the writing is really good and he has subscribers to his blog 
01:15 and some of the content is paid, he went through some really rough times 
01:19 and some really challenging times, 
01:22 but came through and generated quite successful business, 
01:25 so his blog at the time of this recording I am sure it's actually gone way pass this 
01:30 because it was growing quickly, he had 20 thousand subscribers to his paid blog, 
01:35 and that's a 10 dollars per person, per month. 
01:38 So, that's something like 240 thousand dollars a year, for blogging. 
01:42 So, he goes through, and normally, what they talk about is other businesses, 
01:47 but it so happens somehow that James talks Ben into talking about his business, 
01:52 how it came to be and so on.
01:55 So, I would say you should really listen to this if you've got some extra time
01:59 and you want to just get some of these ideas percolate. 
02:02 First ten minutes, maybe first eleven minutes are kind of rambly, they bounce around,
02:06 so go and listen to that if you want or if you are like this is nonsense, 
02:09 skip to minute eleven or something to this effect, 
02:13 you can see the link there at the bottom, I think it's case sensitive, so be careful. 
02:17 You'll hear them talk about a few things, they talk about the jungle floor 
02:21 and they talk about this thing called a canopy, and so on, 
02:24 and what they are talking about is on the internet, 
02:26 there is really room for two types of companies, 
02:29 there is room for huge companies that that just take over, 
02:32 so Amazon taking over online shopping, Google taking over search, 
02:36 Facebook taking over social, things like that, 
02:39 there is only a few of those and they those the things that live 
02:42 at the top of the canopy; and then, there is the very niche stuff 
02:45 that lives at the bottom of the floor, like python podcast, 
02:48 or training for people working on raspberry pi, 
02:53 or various specialized stuff that can never be quite big enough to be huge businesses 
02:57 and so you'll hear those references without explanation 
03:01 because they talked about it in previous episodes. 
03:03 If you've got an extra hour, and you just want to listen to something, 
03:07 I strongly recommend you listen to like minute eleven onward of this episode, 
03:12 it will really give you some insight into all of the stuff that we were talking about here.

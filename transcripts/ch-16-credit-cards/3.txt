00:02 Are you ready to see what this Stripe checkout is all about?
00:05 One of the things you'll hear often when people talk about these checkout flows 
00:09 and accepting credit cards are the funnels, conversion funnel, 
00:12 purchase funnel and so on, and you want the number of steps involved, 
00:16 and the amount of information to be entered as minimal as possible, 
00:20 and as far as I can tell, this Stripe checkout 
00:23 is the absolute bare minimum for new customers. 
00:27 So, let's see how this works, first I'll show what we have on Talk Python Training, 
00:31 and how I use it, you may recognize this as we go through it, 
00:34 and then I'll show you a little bit of behind the scenes on stripe.com 
00:38 and then we are going to write the code ourself. 
00:42 OK, so over here, we can go pick a course, you can see I am not logged in,
00:45 let's just pick the Jumpstart course, and come down here you can see 
00:49 there is a button here that says buy now, get lifetime access for 69 dollars. 
00:53 So, if i click this, notice I am not logged in,
00:58 It says OK we are going to buy this course, here is a little logo, 
01:02 I can put in my email, if I were logged in, that email would already be pre-populated, 
01:06 so I am going to put in a credit card, expiration date, CVC 
01:10 and I hit pay and that's the entire funnel, that's the entire process. 
01:14 This happens on Stripe server, this is actually coming from Stripe. 
01:19 What I put here never goes to my server, it only goes to Stripe. 
01:24 Now, once this is submitted, a token, a one-time token will be sent back 
01:28 to my Pyramid web app and then we'll do the processing to basically enter you 
01:33 in the course so that I know to give you access to it, things like that. 
01:36 So over here at stripe.com/checkout,
01:39 they have many different options for what you can do, 
01:42 but you can see they have a little example to show you what it looks like, 
01:46 it looks similar to what I just showed you, right? 
01:49 So, to get started, they have some documentation and basically 
01:52 all you have to do besides having a Stripe account, 
01:55 which does not require special type of bank account or anything, 
01:59 just any account to transfer money into 
02:01 when you get paid, right, that's the good part. 
02:04 You have an account, you have a bank account, you set up an account with Stripe, 
02:08 and then you get an API code here and then this is all you need, it's just this script, 
02:13 so you can see all of this, these details, this data, 
02:17 -key, data-amount and so on, this drives the UI that you saw. 
02:21 Here you can see the script that is running this actually comes from Stripe, 
02:25 and then you've got a final POST back that you are going to go 
02:29 and this is where you receive the token to finalize the payment. 
02:32 Now you are trading a little bit of flexibility here, 
02:38 lack of flexibility for both avoiding some of the PCI compliance issues 
02:43 as well as simplicity, all this checkout stuff and verification you don't have to do, 
02:47 so for example if I come over here and I put in just some random stuff, 
02:53 and I put like 11/11 of course that's expired, 123 and I try to pay it says 
03:01 no, no, look, those two things are wrong, already, 
03:05 so if I put- no, no, I meant 21, all this nice validation is already good, 
03:09 apparently that came back as some kind of credit card 
03:12 but they don't only have just the UI for it but all the validation 
03:16 and it's kind of playful as well, so let's go see 
03:20 how we can take this API and embed it into our web app to buy albums.

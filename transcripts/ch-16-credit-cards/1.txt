00:02 So are you ready to learn about how to take your online web app 
00:05 and make money with it?
00:08 Accept credit cards, set up business models, 
00:10 talk a little bit about charging for products, things like that? 
00:14 Well those are the kinds of things we are going to learn in this chapter, 
00:17 we are going to start with accepting credit cards and actually working with the APIs 
00:21 as well as just talking more generally about some of the options we have 
00:24 for creating and accepting purchases via credit cards in our web applications. 
00:29 Once you start accepting money, you will have to of course have a business model 
00:34 and that has sort of two components in my mind, 
00:37 on one is how do you form a company, right? 
00:41 Once you accept money and you start entering purchase agreements with people, 
00:44 you don't want to do this personally, right, 
00:47 you want to do this through some kind of formal business that has limited liability, 
00:50 or some kind of protection for you, at least in the United States, 
00:53 the two primary models are LLC (Limited Liability Companies) and Corporations, 
00:58 so we'll talk a little bit about that 
01:00 and even if you are outside of the United States 
01:03 how you can still create one of these within the US as a US company, 
01:07 if that makes sense.
01:09 The other part of this is how do you actually sell your product, 
01:12 do you sell by recurring subscriptions? Do you sell by one-off purchases? 
01:16 do you not sell it at all but sell ads? Things like this, 
01:20 we'll talk about some of the trade-offs there. 
01:23 And finally, we'll also talk about other ways to accept money from customers, 
01:26 we'll see that many of your best customers won't put their credit cards into your system,
01:31 instead, they will say can we do a bulk purchase? 
01:34 Can we buy something for my team? I'd like to set up some kind of arrangement 
01:38 for my whole company, things like that, 
01:40 and for that you typically use purchase orders and invoices, 
01:43 so we'll talk very briefly about those as well. 
01:45 Now, once you've created your web app, it can be scary to charge for money. 
01:49 But there is a picture I want you to keep in your mind, 
01:53 something like this- it's definitely something that's hard to get right, 
01:56 how much should you charge? What business models should you use? If you charge, will all of your users quit? 
02:00 Instead of thinking of charging money as a negative, think of it as a positive. 
02:05 As long as you are fair, charging money will allow your business to grow, 
02:09 it will allow you to hire other people to make whatever your users like now, 
02:13 make that more awesome and provide more value to them. 
02:16 Not everybody will pay for what you have, 
02:18 maybe you have some kind of free trial model or something to this effect, 
02:22 I don't know what your web app is, but your business will definitely be well, 
02:26 a business and not a hobby if you charge money for it 
02:29 and it will let you put all of your time and energy into it once you get it to grow strong enough. 
02:33 So think of charging money or asking for money from your customers and users 
02:38 really as your ability to grow. 
02:41 They are getting value out of what you are doing, 
02:43 many of them will be more than happy to support your work long as you are fair about it. 
02:48 The path is not always a straight line to where you are going. 
02:52 Let me give you a little bit of example from how I started. 
02:55 In April of 2015 I started the podcast, 
02:59 and in the beginning it was just a hobby more or less, 
03:03 I never really expected anybody would sponsor it, 
03:06 you can see there is an ad at the top of the page, I didn't expect that, 
03:10 that was a pleasant surprise and so I started this as just something to share 
03:14 with the community, start telling stories and something I wanted to do 
03:19 but then I realized after companies came and started to want to sponsor and so on, 
03:23 that maybe I could make something more out of this, 
03:26 maybe I could actually if I could take it a little bit farther, 
03:29 I could actually make this my job, make the podcast more awesome, 
03:32 put more energy into it, make sure that it keeps going, things like that. 
03:36 Moreover, I had always wanted to start some kind of online training company 
03:40 but there is such a chicken and egg problem of how do you find people 
03:45 who like what you are doing, how do you get people to know about you, 
03:49 how do you get them to trust you. 
03:51 Instead of just going and saying starting this company directly,
03:54 I actually started the podcast first and then once that had a good audience 
03:59 and people knew me and trusted me from there, then I felt confident 
04:02 to actually go and launch Talk Python Training where you are taking this course. 
04:07 So had I just gone and tried to start this training company on my own, 
04:10 maybe I would have succeeded but the odds would have certainly been against it, 
04:15 it would have been much harder than if I already had built up some kind of audience. 
04:19 Maybe I could have made this work going through some other training company 
04:23 and try and work basically as a subcontractor like an author on royalties sort of thing, 
04:27 but starting my own business that was quite risky.
04:30 However, with the podcast there as the foundation, then it becomes not so risky, 
04:35 so I want you to think about all the building blocks in the way 
04:38 you might create one thing and then level it up to another 
04:41 instead of necessarily just going directly towards the thing 
04:44 that you might have in mind at the end. 
04:47 OK, so there is many building blocks, 
04:49 many ways to put this together and build up a business and just be creative.

00:00 OK, we have all the information we need, 
00:02 I guess that we probably want to send this email after this successful purchase, 
00:08 so we've got this, we need this little print out, I don't think we need that anymore, 
00:12 that was just a test that we were getting the user and the album passed through correctly, 
00:16 we got our Stripe token correctly, now it's just down to doing this bit of code, 
00:20 let me just verify logged_in_user, album, price and token, 
00:25 user, album, price and token. 
00:28 OK, so there is two steps to do, one is to save this to the database, 
00:32 that is going to be easy, we are going to do that here, so let's just go ahead, 
00:35 we are going to create our purchase, it's AlbumPurchase, 
00:40 we want to create one of these and let's see what it takes, 
00:46 it has an id, we don't have to do anything there, 
00:48 created is auto-set, these four though,
00:51 description, let's set description last, amount_paid, 
00:55 say like this purchase=..., purchase.amount_paid, is going to be amount_paid_usd,
01:04 purchase.user_id is going to be user.id, 
01:12 album_id is going to be album.id and that's like this, 
01:17 finally, we'll just say purchase.description is going to be something like, 
01:23 we'll set that in the line above 
01:26 and then we just say session.add(purchase), session.commit. 
01:32 Standard SQLAlchemy. So this records it for us. 
01:35 The other thing we need to do is record it in Stripe. 
01:39 So let's go over here, and we'll say CreditCard..., 
01:43 I moved all the Stripe stuff over here, 
01:47 we'll say complete_stripe_purchase and it's going to take the token, 
01:51 description and the price in US dollars, amount_paid... 
01:56 So let's go and set this description, OK, so that's what that's going to be, 
02:01 and then, I think in order to complete this purchase, we are also going to need 
02:05 the identity, so the email, but that may come with the token, 
02:08 we're going to find out in the second. 
02:10 No, actually, we are not going to pass the email here, 
02:13 because it was previously associated with the token in that checkout form, 
02:17 so it will just remember the email, so we are going to do this, 
02:20 and then we are also going to say StoreService.__record_purchase() 
02:25 and it needs user.id, album.id, amount_paid_usd and the description. 
02:33 So those two things we are going to do, 
02:36 I probably should add a little more validation and error handling, 
02:39 but for this demo, we are just going to roll with this. 
02:42 OK, so final step is to implement that right there. 
02:45 You can see we haven't gotten far. It turns out the Stripe API is quite simple,
02:51 we just need to use the Stripe package, so I am going to go up here and import it, 
02:56 and PyCharm will take care of it for us on a couple of levels, 
02:59 so it is going to say first of all, install that package, that seemed to go well, 
03:05 next add it to the requirements, to the setup, OK, 
03:09 and now this last one is hey you are not using it, 
03:11 well, that is what we are going to do now.
03:14 So the way it works is we have to set up, first compute the price, 
03:18 price in USD, price_in_cents (USD) or let me just leave like price_in_cents, 
03:26 we are going to round this up, and we are going to take the price in US dollars 
03:32 and we are going to round base 10 and of course convert that from dollars to cents, 
03:37 OK, so there is our price, we already have our description, 
03:41 and the next thing we need to do is set the API key 
03:44 so we'll say stripe.api_key = CreditCardProcessor.__private key, like so, 
03:55 not the public key, the private key, this is the one you don't share, 
03:58 and then all we have to do is create a charge, say stripe.Charge.create 
04:06 and here we have to pass a few things, 
04:10 the amount, it's going to be equal to price_in_cents, 
04:15 you don't want to get one one hundredth of what you expected, do you? No, 
04:21 currency='USD' source is going to be the stripe_token 
04:31 and the description=desc. 
04:37 And then we can return the charge for whoever wants to inspect it, 
04:40 record details about it and so on. 
04:43 OK, so let's just do a quick thing back here, just do a cleanup, 
04:55 and let me just print out the charge, so that we can see what happens here. 
04:59 Now there is a lot of moving parts, but I think we got it right, let's give it a try,
05:03 so I want to come over here, to this album and I want to buy the album, 
05:08 I am going to put in my test card, remember you will get really good at this, 
05:12 because you do this a lot, we can go to our service, 
05:18 it's going to finalize this with Stripe and we of course did something wrong here, 
05:24 our stripe error invalid request looks like I need to convert that to an integer. 
05:29 I thought we were so close. OK, let's do this. 
05:35 Try it again, Now I could try to do this again, let's see, 
05:44 is it going to rerun it or is it going to crash. 
05:48 Oh look at that, store success, 
05:52 now we are missing the template so it doesn't feel so good,
05:55 right, it didn't go "yes, you purchased just album, thank you, 
05:58 here is your download link" or whatever, 
06:00 but, it went through, the charge went through. 
06:05 So here you can see all the information we got back. 
06:09 This is what came back from Stripe.
06:14 OK, here is the amount, amount refunded, etc, etc, 
06:18 the name of the purchase, the id, this is the thing we can go back 
06:23 and look up in our Stripe dashboard, the exact name of the id 
06:26 so maybe we want to put that on the purchase record, 
06:30 it would be a really good idea to do that, we are not doing it, and so on. 
06:34 OK, so our Stripe purchase worked, we just need to write that template, 
06:38 so I'll do that and pause the video and you can check it our in a second. 
06:43 Here we go, that's better, right, I just wrote the template and refreshed it 
06:47 and notice I also added the actual album that we purchased so you can say 
06:51 thank you for purchasing such and such, you can have a download link, 
06:55 whatever you need to do to like get them their deliverable
06:58 that they are looking for when they purchased it. 
07:01 So over here, we already had in the "complete", we had the album id, 
07:05 so I just took that onto the end and then just again, grabbed it and success, 
07:10 we also have a failed and it just says "sorry, that failed, try again", 
07:14 we could grab the error message out of the Stripe colon, things like that 
07:19 and carry some more messages on in the fail thing, 
07:23 but for the most part those were already done by Stripe, 
07:26 there will be a few that could fail, so for example, if I hit the back button here, 
07:31 and I refreshed it, trying to apply this token twice would cause an error, things like that.
07:35 OK, so there you have it, we have added credit card processing 
07:41 via Stripe checkout to our application.
07:43 Remember, all you need is a bank account, 
07:46 that can accept direct deposits or automatic, 
07:49 electronic transfers to have a Stripe account, so theoretically, 
07:52 if this were set up correctly and it was not in test mode, 
07:56 that money would be transferred two days later, there is a two day delay 
08:01 and transferring the money that you get, 
08:03 Stripe holds on to it for a little bit in case there is some kind of complaint, 
08:06 and then they send it on your way.

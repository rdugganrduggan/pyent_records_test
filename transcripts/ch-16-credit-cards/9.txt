00:02 We saw that once the Stripe checkout stuff is all done and everything passes
00:08 and the user says "bye", Stripe verifies it,
00:11 then it does a POST back with a token to our own web application. 
00:15 And here is the code that ran that basically used the Stripe API
00:20 to do that final checkout to actually process the purchase, 
00:24 remember, we get a token but that token is not yet claimed, 
00:28 but no purchase has actually happened until we call and create a charge on the Stripe API.
00:33 So here we go, we've got a Stripe token and in this case 
00:36 imagine we want to buy a course at Talk Python To Me Training, then, 
00:40 we're going to compute the price, remember, in cents, 
00:44 we want this in cents, not dollars, 
00:47 we are going to set the description, this is going to be what shows up on their credit card,
00:51 what shows up in our records when we download the records from Stripe, things like that, 
00:55 so we'll set the description, we have to set our API key to our secret key, 
00:59 our private key not, the public one, make sure that use in the live key 
01:03 if you want things to be live, you also have to flip a switch on your account 
01:07 that says "going to live mode", don't forget that, 
01:09 and then we just say stripe.charge.create 
01:12 we give it the amount, currency, the token as the source and the description 
01:16 and you see we got back a tremendous amount of dictionaries or nested dictionaries 
01:22 all sorts of information about fraud, about what the purchase id was and so on, 
01:27 so you can store as much or as little of that as like you can get back 
01:31 to that information through the Stripe dashboard in your account, 
01:34 but sometimes, it's good to have it stored right in your database. 
01:38 Hopefully that was not too intimidating, I think adding credit card payments 
01:42 to your web app especially using Stripe checkout is really quite straightforward, 
01:47 there is a few steps, but with the code that you've got from these samples, 
01:51 and the examples, the concepts and so on, 
01:54 I think you should be able to get it working no problem, 
01:57 so best of luck and fingers crossed for that first credit card purchase to come through.

00:02 Let's review what it took to get Stripe checkout integrated with our webpage. 
00:07 Remember, all we really had to do was add a little bit of HTML 
00:10 that referenced the checkout script, set some properties, 
00:14 probably dynamically computed from our Chameleon templates, 
00:18 and Stripe took care of the rest. 
00:21 So here you can see we've got our form, we've put it onto our page 
00:24 and this is actually the checkout code for the training website where you buy courses. 
00:28 So, the action is /purchase/complete/${course.url}
00:33 because we need to figure out what course you purchased and then the source, 
00:38 notice the HTTPS is highlighted to the Stripe js, it's really important 
00:42 that this code runs on a page that is running over SSL so you don't get in a trouble, 
00:46 and then you have to pass in your Stripe public key 
00:50 and here we're grabbing it off the base controller 
00:53 but in another example we just passed it as part of the dictionary, 
00:56 we have to set the amount in cents and the default is US dollars in cents, 
01:01 here we're setting the active email, so if you happen to be logged in,
01:05 then it will automatically prefill that, but you don't have to be, 
01:10 it will just be empty and you fill it in, turn off "remember", set the name, 
01:14 this is the name of the company you are buying it from, remember across the top, 
01:17 we are also setting the data-image to set the picture, right, that's a little icon, 
01:22 the little Talk Python To Me icon, 
01:25 you want a label to say what it is you are buying
01:27 so buy the course for this price, and you also get a little bit longer description 
01:31 but none of these get to be very long, so be sure to test them. 
01:34 And that's it, you out this on your page, it's going to prefil and preload 
01:39 and put a little button that will say whatever it says 
01:42 in this case it will say "buy course for this amount of money", when they click it, 
01:46 it's going to go through all the checkout process, 
01:48 with the few things that you have there, 
01:51 and finally if it does work correctly, it's going to post back to purchase/complete/url. 
01:57 So you have this button, you'll be able to click it and when the user clicks it 
02:01 you'll see something like this. 
02:04 Really nice, we saw this form is quite smart, 
02:08 it does a little wiggly animation to tell if the things are not right, 
02:11 it's quite intuitive and friendly, and it's a very good purchase funnel 
02:15 because there is very little to fill out here, 
02:18 especially if your email is already prepopulated.

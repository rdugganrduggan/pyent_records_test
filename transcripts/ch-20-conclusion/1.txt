00:01 There it is, at last, the finish line, you've done it!
00:05 Congratulations, you've made it to the end of this course 
00:08 and wow, was this a long one;
00:11 you've learned so many things, it turns out there's a lot of stuff 
00:15 that you need to know to build your online business, right?
00:18 But you now have this power, you know all of the moving parts 
00:22 you have a formula to create a successful online business.
00:26 That doesn't mean it's going to be easy, but at least you know what the steps are 
00:30 and there shouldn't be a ton of surprises along the way.
00:34 The big question is what are you going to build now?
00:37 I really hope you build something truly amazing, 
00:40 I hope this course played some small part in it 
00:43 and I wish you the best of success.

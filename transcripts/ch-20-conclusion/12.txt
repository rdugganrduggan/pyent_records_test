00:01 One of the best ways to drive long term sustainable growth to your business 
00:04 is through content marketing, and using search engine optimization or SEO,
00:10 in order to increase the traffic that goes to the content you've created. 
00:14 Remember that content marketing is about giving useful, accurate information 
00:19 that is of interest to your prospective customers. 
00:22 The content that you write or that you create 
00:25 whether that's text or video or sound clips 
00:28 is going to be specific to your business, 
00:30 you have to understand your own customers 
00:33 and create content that is going to be relevant to them. 
00:36 Always think about it as helping them solve a problem that they have,
00:41 don't sales pitch them on your own product.
00:44 Your product should be part of their solution, but it is not the only thing 
00:47 that will take away all of their problems.
00:50 Really the content works hand in hand with what you're creating 
00:53 in order to solve their problems, so you don't need to hard sales pitch them 
00:57 in order for them to be interested in what you've created.
01:00 SEO is a set of tactics that allow you to increase your rankings in goggle over time 
01:06 it won't happen overnight, but when you follow certain practices 
01:10 SEO is guaranteed to help your rankings.
01:14 Now what are those things that are involved with SEO?
01:17 Well, first you want to make sure that your title tag, your header tags 
01:22 and the meta description tag in your html 
01:26 all map to what your content is actually about.
01:29 And there are certain limitations that we covered, 
01:32 such as having a short title that is give take set less than seventy characters 
01:37 and other guidelines like that, that are going to help you to improve 
01:40 your SEO rank over time, that are openly promoted by google and other search engines 
01:46 that are actually informing you how you should handle these elements.
01:49 Keep the content length to at minimum 750 characters to 2,000 characters on a 01:56 page, anything that's larger than that should be broken up 
01:59 and anything less than about 750 characters on content you've created 
02:02 is typically not dense enough for it to rank highly in search engine results.
02:08 Use a flat url structure, don't nest your urls to deeply,
02:13 so for example, if you have a .com and you have then /blog 
02:17 and /the year, the month, the day, all in different folders, 
02:21 that will actually hurt your SEO results, 
02:24 because your content is to far nested down a folder path. 
02:28 Always keep an eye on your site low time and the page speed 
02:32 and support all mobile devices by having a responsive design 
02:36 which recovered earlier in the course.
02:39 Make sure that the site low time stays low 
02:41 because fast performing sites are ranked higher in search engine results.
02:45 Also make sure to not bog down your site with additional Javascript 
02:50 that is unnecessary or social widgets and tracking snippets 
02:54 that don't provide you with actual value on your site 
02:57 and take away from the experience that your users have 
03:01 when they're trying to read your content.

00:01 I hope you're convinced that mailing lists are very valuable.
00:04 Having a mailing list while not as sexy or publicly visible 
00:08 as like twenty thousand followers on facebook or on twitter,
00:11 is actually much more valuable.
00:14 We talked about how to set up MailChimp, 
00:17 we also talked about some of the other options, such as Drip and customer.io 
00:21 whatever you choose, definitely focus on having a mailing list;
00:25 it's one of the really hidden secrets of a successful business.
00:29 Here you can see many of these new businesses 
00:33 before they even launch, they'll have this page they are like hey, we're coming soon
00:36 definitely definitely sign up for a mailing list, 
00:39 so we can tell you when it's ready to launch.
00:42 And we want to talk about like how do you add a subscriber, right,
00:45 we talked about forms and having people submit forms and validation,
00:48 but inside your form, like how do you actually do this.
00:51 You could have your own database, and your own mail system,
00:55 but don't do that, use MailChimp or something equivalent.
00:58 For using MailChimp, you just go and create their API,
01:01 you give him the key and you just call list.subscribe 
01:03 give it the mailing list id that you are using, and a few options 
01:06 and boom- they're all automatically set up.
01:09 Then whenever you're ready to announce your big thing 
01:12 you go to MailChimp and you send an email to everyone who's signed up.

00:01 It's so exciting to create a new business and work on all these things.
00:04 But you shouldn't try to do it all, you should think about 
00:07 where your skills are best applied and where it would be much better 
00:12 to just spend a little bit of money to get someone to help you out.
00:15 So we talked about two primary places to get help.
00:18 Do you need help with things like, 
00:22 let's say in our case video editing or transcripts,
00:25 or stuff that's not your primary goal, but it is a really important part of your work.
00:30 Upwork is an awesome place to do this, I have a bunch of people 
00:33 that work with me through Upwork and I am really happy with that whole setup.
00:36 Now graphic design is another really big challenge, 
00:41 especially when you're getting started.
00:43 We talked about ninety 99 designs and how you can go here 
00:45 and basically set up what's called a contest 
00:47 and maybe 50 people will come and propose designs and iterate their designs 
00:51 and you pick one and you probably come up with something really excellent.
00:55 My experience is being great a few times I've used them as well.

00:01 Once we had our site up and running on the internet, in production,
00:05 we said well, let's make sure that we can actually charge some money for this thing.
00:09 So we said there's a lot of credit card options out there, 
00:12 Stripe is one of the easiest, most widely accepted 
00:16 and really respected ones out there. 
00:19 And if you want to get started quick and in a really smooth, short, checkout flow 
00:24 this checkout is actually really amazing.
00:27 So we said look, all we have to do to use checkout is to come over here 
00:31 and basically add this form, this script to our page.
00:34 So we're going to include the checkout javascript and then this little bit of html.
00:39 Notice we're passing our key, things like how much we want to charge them,
00:43 the name of the thing that we're charging them,
00:45 and then when they click on the button that appears here,
00:48 it's just going to pop up this single dialogue
00:51 you enter four pieces of information, hit the button and boom, it's done,
00:56 that's the entire check out flow; but the card is not charged yet.
01:00 Stripe comes back to you and it posts to one of your methods
01:04 the user doesn't really see this, but after Stripe has already verified 
01:09 that it would be ok to do this, you get this Stripe token passed to you. 
01:13 So when the Stripe token comes in then you have to take this 
01:17 and actually go to the Stripe API in Python, go to this charge class and create one.
01:22 If that works okay, then you record it, you give them aces 
01:26 to whatever they were going to buy;
01:28 if it doesn't, you record the error and you send them some kind of message.
01:31 By this point, it's mostly gone through the verification process
01:34 once that little Stripe check out dialogue goes away 
01:37 you're like 90 percent there, but there is a possibility of some kind of error,
01:41 so be sure to work with this carefully.

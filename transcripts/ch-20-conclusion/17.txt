00:01 We covered growth hacking which is essentially
00:03 just software developers rediscovering marketing and branding it in their own terms.
00:07 Ultimately for any web based business, you're going to have a funnel 
00:11 where the goal is to move people from unaware that you even exist
00:15 through awareness, interest in your business, evaluating what you're offering 
00:22 signing up to try out your product, using it and paying for it as well.
00:29 So to move them from not even knowing about you,
00:32 all the way through happy paying customer.
00:35 With any growth hacking tactic that you hear about
00:38 and that you want to try, ask yourself where in the funnel does it fit,
00:41 measure that part of the funnel with analytics 
00:44 so if that's awareness and interest you're measuring with google analytics 
00:48 in order to determine how many people are actually coming and visiting your site.
00:52 And then, determine whether that strategy is working for you or not. 
00:56 You can read things like a thousand tips for growth hacking 
01:00 but ultimately you are going to only be able to chose a few of them at a time 
01:03 that you're going to test out, so that you can see which ones are actually working 
01:07 and which ones aren't worth the time that you're investing in trying them out.
01:10 Now what works for one business may not work for another 
01:13 but you can take inspiration from examples 
01:16 and try to incorporate tests into your business 
01:19 to determine whether they work for you.
01:21 We covered five examples, the first one was awareness on turkey carving 
01:25 taking one piece of code and writing several blog posts about it,
01:28 maybe adding a video into the mix, 
01:31 maybe even taking that same code and rewriting it in different programming language 
01:34 and then also writing several more blog posts on it.
01:37 The gist here is take what's hard about what you're doing,
01:40 the content that you're trying to create, and then create multiple variations off of it,
01:44 with less work than if you had to come up with a new original idea 
01:47 every single time you want to produce a piece of content.
01:51 Michael uses a great strategy for resending e mail campaigns 
01:55 to people that have not opened the previous campaign;
01:58 if someone receives an email but perhaps it goes with their spam folder 
02:02 or they delete it by accident, they may never see your message 
02:05 and through tools like MailChimp, you can resend to people 
02:09 that are on your mailing list, but have not opened your email 
02:12 so that you can ensure that there is a higher deliverability 
02:15 and that more people see what you're trying to say to them.
02:18 One way to drive usage and adoption of your product 
02:21 could be through open sourcing part or all of your code,
02:24 we saw a really great example with Sidekiq 
02:27 where the developer is creating a tool and the tool was more rapidly adopted 
02:32 because it was open source and developers could just pick it up and try it out,
02:35 and then when companies needed to have support on that product 
02:38 they were able to just pay him directly and he was able to create new features on it.
02:42 So consider this strategy depending on your business 
02:45 if you're doing anything around coding or you need more developer adoption.
02:49 The right call to action is really crucial, and making sure that people move 
02:53 from the evaluating stage to the sign up stage.
02:57 You want to make it as easy as possible, for people to say 
03:00 all right sure, I'll give it a try, this looks like it might solve my problem.
03:03 So we took a look at several examples of calls to action,
03:07 to see what you might be able to use as design for your own landing pages.
03:10 Finally, we took a look at a bunch of examples of pricing tables 
03:14 to determine how you might be able to best position your product 
03:18 for prospective customers, and certain psychological tricks 
03:22 that you can use with the pricing tables 
03:24 so that people can pick the right plan that is most appropriate for you
03:28 running your business that also solves their problems.

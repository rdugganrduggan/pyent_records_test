00:00 We've both been looking forward to this chance to share all of these ideas with you 
00:04 and we hope you take them and build something amazing.
00:08 If you're looking for more inspiration, you can stop by the podcast,
00:11 and sign up and listen to shows on all sorts of topics,
00:14 and hopefully they give you ideas and directions to go in;
00:18 or, drop over at Matt's site.
00:20 All of the topics that I covered such as git and deployments 
00:23 I cover on Full Stack Python as well, you'll be able to read 
00:27 not only about those topics, but related ones,
00:29 and if you have questions
00:31 please drop me an email or send me a message on twitter.
00:34 Thank you so much for taking our course, 
00:37 it's really been great to have as student and we'll see you online.

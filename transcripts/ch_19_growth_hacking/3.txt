00:01 Let's talk about a pro tip that Michael taught me 
00:03 which fits into the funnel around the evaluation and sign up process. 
00:06 It can also be used for existing customers 
00:09 if you're emailing certain things out to them, like a new feature. 
00:12 Once you have perspective or current customers' email addresses, 
00:15 they've opted in to your email list you, can not only send them emails 
00:18 you can send follow up emails if they never even open 
00:21 the original email that you sent to them. 
00:24 A couple of cases where this is really good- if you've got an email newsletter 
00:27 and you're excited to announce the big launch of your application, 
00:30 and only 50 percent of people even opened that email, 
00:34 you can follow up a week later with another email slightly different subject line 
00:37 and hopefully get some percentage of that 50 percent 
00:40 which didn't open your original email to open up, and then read the new email. 
00:45 Likewise, if you have an existing customer base, 
00:48 you've got some great new features and 20 percent of the people 
00:51 just never even opened the email, you can do the same thing with them. 
00:54 Let's take a look in an example. 
00:56 Back in August, I sent out an email to my Full Stack Python newsletter list, 
00:59 an email list of any sufficient size is going to have a significant chunk of people 
01:04 who never even open an email that you send, 
01:07 regardless of how the subject line is worded. In this case, the subject line was 
01:11 "less than 24 hours to back the Python for Entrepreneurs video course", 
01:14 this was on when the course was originally on Kickstarter. 
01:17 Now I'm in MailChimp, and we can see the results 
01:20 of this campaign, if we just scroll down a little bit. 
01:22 A little over 50 percent of people opened up this email, 
01:26 10.5 percent of people clicked through one of the links in the email; 
01:30 that is fairly common, and we can see over time, 
01:33 once we sent the email out, people tend to open it up in spurts 
01:37 and then there's a long tale of traffic over the next 24 hours. 
01:41 But what about after a week? Chances are most people 
01:44 are not going to be opening up their email, I know that I open up 
01:47 a lot of my email newsletters on the weekend, 
01:50 oftentimes I just miss things or I am bulk deleting a bunch of emails 
01:53 and getting a follow up email would be just fine by me. 
01:57 So what we can do in MailChip or most likely whatever email software you're using,
02:00 is you can resend in an open campaign. 
02:03 I'll give the link out to this at the end. 
02:06 Essentially, once you have a campaign and you can replicate that campaign, 
02:10 you can change the title of it, and then you can send it out to a certain group, 
02:15 and if you follow these steps you get to the point where you can 
02:19 send it out to everyone who has not opened up this newsletter. 
02:23 So that's super helpful for bumping up the effective rate 
02:26 at which people open up your email newsletters. 
02:30 You want to be selective when using this, you don't want to spam people, 
02:33 but if you got a really important announcement 
02:35 and you want to make sure to maximize the number of people that open up the email 
02:38 that announces something that you've worked really hard on, 
02:41 this can be a great way to do that. 
02:43 You can go to this link here, and this shows you how exactly 
02:46 to do it with your own campaign.

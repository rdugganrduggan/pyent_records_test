00:01 You built your business, you've deployed your application, 
00:04 you're up and running, but how do people discover you?
00:07 What if no one shows up? Unless you already have a customer list 
00:10 of people who are waiting to get their other hands on your application
00:13 you're going to have to do some legwork to go out and get customers.
00:16 Previous chapter we talked about search engine optimization, content marketing, 
00:20 and that can form the foundation for drawing customers.
00:22 But I'd like to go over some examples 
00:25 of how to think about acquiring customers for your business.
00:27 I've titled this chapter growth hacking, 
00:29 but really, growth hacking is software developers rediscovering marketing 
00:33 and then rebranding it, because they didn't want to call themselves marketers. 
00:37 Although when you think about it, it's kind of ingenious for developers 
00:40 to rebrand marketing and do something may consider to be a hotter topic.
00:44 That's kind of what marketing is anyway.
00:46 Growth hacking can seem like one of those arcane arts 
00:49 just like search engine optimization, 
00:51 so I want to provide a simple framework to think about 
00:53 how you can get started acquiring more customers.
00:56 And it all comes down to understanding your costumer funnel- what's the funnel?
01:00 The reason we call it a funnel is because 
01:02 you can actually visualize it as a funnel;
01:04 the first step is getting awareness for your product.
01:07 Most people when they hear about what you've built 
01:10 aren't going to be ready to buy, but if you can at least get them on your site 
01:13 get them reading your content, get them to understand who you are, 
01:16 that's the first step towards them potentially becoming a customer,
01:21 if they need what you're selling. There are many ways to visualize a funnel 
01:24 and a lot of it's going to depend on what type of business you're building. 
01:27 When you search for a customer funnel in google 
01:29 you'll see a lot of different variations on the customer funnel.
01:32 I've just picked some steps that I think are likely to be the most appropriate 
01:35 for the types of businesses that are enabled by building a web application.
01:39 Think about each of these customer steps throughout the funnel 
01:42 and then figure out how they apply to your specific business.
01:47 Once a customer has awareness of your business, 
01:49 only a certain percentage of them are actually going to be interested in what you're selling, 
01:53 and that's fine, not everybody is going to be a customer of yours.
01:56 In fact, being specific about who you're selling to 
01:58 is really important for making sure that you are actually 
02:01 delivering something of value to your customers.
02:03 If they've got interest, they're likely going to evaluate what you have 
02:07 even if you have a free product or a freemium product that you upsell parts of it later,
02:12 they're still going to evaluate whether they even want to take the time to use your product.
02:16 There are so many web sites out there, 
02:18 so time is a valuable resource the prospective customers would need to spend 
02:22 in order to determine and evaluate what you offer.
02:26 For those that evaluate and decide they want to take the time to try it out, 
02:29 then you get to the sign up phase.
02:32 This is really where you can figure out if they've get through the sign up process 
02:35 whether your application and your business 
02:38 is going to suit the needs of prospective customers. 
02:40 After they've signed up, they'll start using it,
02:42 and you can start getting feedback and engaging with prospective customers.
02:45 If you have A freemium based business,
02:48 the sign up and the payment could be two separate steps;
02:50 if you have a customer that using a free version of your product,
02:53 getting them to pay up whether for advanced features 
02:55 or just to continue after a free trial period 
02:58 is the ultimate goal for making sure that your business is generating revenue.
03:01 The customer journey doesn't end here-
03:04 you need to make sure that what you're delivering is a value to the customer 
03:07 and that they want to continue paying for what you are offering 
03:09 but typically, going from awareness to paying customers
03:12 is a hard enough problem on its own 
03:14 and so that's what we're going to focus on with some specific examples 
03:17 throughout this funnel, I have some good ideas 
03:19 that you may want to try for your own business.
03:21 Again, I want to emphasize you can't just blindly take other ideas 
03:24 and think that they'll work perfectly in your business;
03:26 every business is different, so the way that you're going to market yours 
03:28 you really need to think through the implications of how you want to do that.
03:32 But, seeing some other examples of how other businesses do it 
03:35 can be really helpful, rather than you having to start from scratch 
03:38 with a blank sheet of paper to do your own marketing efforts. 
03:41 Rather than just roll through a bunch of slides in the rest of this chapter,
03:43 we're just going to work in the web browser 
03:45 and take a look at some examples of growth hacking- marketing.
03:49 The first step for any business is to generate awareness 
03:51 and that's why I want to introduce a concept known as turkey carving 
03:54 as you're spending so much time creating content, trying to draw in perspective customers.
03:58 As they're evaluating what you're building 
04:01 there is some tactical advice around email campaigns 
04:03 that's proven really successful for Michael, I'll show you what that details.
04:08 Now you may have people that are aware of what you do 
04:11 and they're interested, but maybe getting them to use it is the really hard part,
04:15 and that's where putting out either a freemium product or in some cases 
04:18 just open sourcing some code can be really powerful 
04:21 for getting people to take that next step, from being interested 
04:24 to actually using what you've got. 
04:26 If one of the problems is just getting people to sign up,
04:29 take a look at some calls to action, how you can structure your landing pages 
04:33 to increase the chances of someone signing up for your application. 
04:37 Finally, we'll take a look at some pricing tables, 
04:40 break down some of the psychology behind the way 
04:43 that you may want to structure the pricing for your products and services. 
04:46 Let's take a look at some of the examples so you can figure out the best way 
to market your own business.
